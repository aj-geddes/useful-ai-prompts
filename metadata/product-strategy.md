## Research Notes

### Development Insights
This enhanced prompt template was developed through extensive analysis of successful product strategies across multiple industries and company stages. Key findings that shaped the template:

1. **Multi-Persona Approach**: Traditional single-perspective prompts often miss critical insights. By explicitly combining Product Manager, Systems Thinker, and Market Strategist personas, the output captures both internal execution excellence and external market dynamics.

2. **Layered Thinking Frameworks**: Incorporating specific thinking approaches (First Principles, Scenario Planning, etc.) consistently produced more innovative and robust strategies compared to generic "analyze and recommend" instructions.

3. **Structured Output Format**: The comprehensive blueprint format ensures all critical strategy elements are addressed. Testing showed that without explicit structure, AI responses often overlooked key areas like risk mitigation or adaptive mechanisms.

4. **Systems Dynamics Emphasis**: Many product failures stem from misunderstanding ecosystem dynamics. The explicit focus on feedback loops and leverage points helps identify non-obvious opportunities and risks.

### Optimal Use Cases
- **New Market Entry**: Especially powerful for identifying ecosystem dynamics and leverage points
- **Competitive Repositioning**: Helps find differentiation opportunities in crowded markets  
- **Platform Strategy Development**: Excellent for understanding network effects and ecosystem plays
- **Digital Transformation**: Useful for legacy companies navigating technology transitions

### Iteration Patterns
Through testing, these follow-up prompts proved most valuable:
- "Deeper dive on [specific feedback loop]" - Expands on system dynamics
- "Sensitivity analysis on [key assumption]" - Tests strategy robustness
- "Competitive response scenarios" - Anticipates market reactions
- "Implementation barriers analysis" - Identifies execution challenges

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Insufficient Context**: The more specific the input, the more actionable the output
2. **Ignoring Constraints**: Always include real limitations for realistic strategies
3. **Static Thinking**: Markets evolve - use the adaptive mechanisms section actively
4. **Over-complexity**: Start with MVP strategy, then layer in sophistication

### Enhancement Opportunities
Consider combining with:
- Financial modeling prompts for ROI analysis
- Customer research prompts for validation
- Technical architecture prompts for implementation planning
- Team capability assessment prompts for execution readiness
