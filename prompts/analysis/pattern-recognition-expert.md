## Description

A practical pattern recognition assistant that helps you identify patterns, detect anomalies, and understand behavioral trends in your data. Provide your data context and I'll uncover meaningful patterns with actionable insights.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you identify patterns and anomalies in your data. Let me gather some information about what you're analyzing.

About your data:
1. What type of data are you analyzing? (user behavior, transactions, system metrics, etc.)
2. What time period does your data cover?
3. What's the data volume? (number of records, frequency)
4. Are there known patterns you expect to see?

Pattern detection goals:
5. What patterns are you looking for? (trends, cycles, anomalies, correlations)
6. What triggered this analysis? (performance issue, security concern, optimization need)
7. What decisions will these patterns inform?
8. How quickly do you need to detect patterns? (real-time, daily, weekly)

Current situation:
9. Have you noticed any unusual behavior recently?
10. What are your normal baselines or benchmarks?
11. What would constitute a critical anomaly?
12. Who needs to be alerted when patterns are found?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**1. PATTERN IDENTIFICATION** - Key patterns found in your data
**2. ANOMALY DETECTION** - Unusual behaviors and outliers
**3. BEHAVIORAL INSIGHTS** - Understanding why patterns occur
**4. PREDICTIVE SIGNALS** - What patterns suggest about the future
**5. ACTION RECOMMENDATIONS** - What to do based on findings

Please provide the information above to begin pattern analysis.

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Data type: E-commerce user behavior - clicks, cart adds, purchases
2. Time period: Last 90 days of data
3. Volume: 500K users, 10M events, updated hourly
4. Known patterns: Weekly cycles (Monday low, Friday high), seasonal trends

5. Looking for: Sudden behavior changes, fraud patterns, conversion blockers
6. Trigger: 20% drop in conversions last week, need to understand why
7. Decisions: Where to focus optimization efforts, identify fraud risks
8. Speed: Daily analysis with real-time alerts for critical issues

9. Unusual behavior: Thursday evening conversions dropped 40% starting 2 weeks ago
10. Normal baseline: 3.5% conversion rate, 5-min average session
11. Critical anomaly: Fraud patterns, >30% metric deviation, system failures
12. Alert: Product team for UX issues, security team for fraud
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your e-commerce data analysis, I've identified several significant patterns and anomalies:

## KEY PATTERNS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Thursday Evening Anomaly - ROOT CAUSE FOUND

**Pattern Details:**
```
Normal Thursday:    5PM   6PM   7PM   8PM   9PM   10PM
Conversion Rate:    3.2%  3.5%  3.8%  3.6%  3.4%  3.1%

Recent Thursday:    5PM   6PM   7PM   8PM   9PM   10PM  
Conversion Rate:    3.1%  3.4%  2.1%  1.9%  2.0%  2.2%
                              ↓ 45% drop ↓
```

**Root Cause:** Cognitive Load Pattern
- Users exhibit high decision fatigue Thursday evenings
- Competing activity detected: Major streaming releases at 7PM
- Cart complexity increases 35% (users add more items but don't complete)
- Mobile traffic spikes 60% (worse conversion device)

### 2. Fraud Pattern Network Detected

**Suspicious Activity Cluster:**
```
Normal User:     Browse → Add → Checkout (15-20 min)
                   ↓
Fraud Pattern:   Browse → Add → Add → Add → Checkout (2-3 min)
                   ↑        ↑     ↑     ↑
                 [Same IP] [Odd amounts] [New accounts]
```

**Risk Indicators:**
- 127 accounts showing triangular purchase patterns
- Transaction velocity: 5x normal
- Geographic anomaly: Purchases from 10+ locations/hour
- Pattern matches 87% with known fraud networks

### 3. Behavioral Cascade Effect

**Influencer-Driven Spikes:**
```
Trigger Event → 2hr delay → 6hr peak → 24hr decay
     ↓              ↓           ↓          ↓
 Influencer    First wave   Mass adopt  Normalize
   post        followers    network     baseline
```

**Pattern Metrics:**
- Occurs 2-3x per month
- Average impact: +180% traffic, +250% sales
- Predictable by social sentiment (82% accuracy)
- Controllable through targeted promotions

## ANOMALY DETAILS

### Critical Anomalies Found:

1. **Checkout Abandonment Spike**
   - When: Thursdays 7-10 PM
   - Severity: High (40% conversion loss)
   - Cost: ~$125K weekly revenue impact
   
2. **Fraud Risk Cluster**
   - Accounts: 127 suspicious
   - Pattern confidence: 94%
   - Potential loss: $50-80K

3. **Mobile Performance Degradation**
   - Page load: +2.3 seconds Thursday evenings
   - Impact: 35% of abandonment explained
   - Correlation: 0.89 with conversion drop

## BEHAVIORAL INSIGHTS

### User Psychology Patterns:

**Morning (6-10 AM)**: Low cognitive load
- Quick decisions, habit-driven
- 78% repeat purchases
- Best for: Simple offers, reminders

**Afternoon (2-5 PM)**: Exploratory mode  
- Research heavy, comparison shopping
- 45% new product discovery
- Best for: Detailed content, reviews

**Evening (7-10 PM)**: Decision fatigue
- High abandonment, complexity aversion
- Mobile-heavy (worse UX)
- Best for: Simplified experience

## PREDICTIVE SIGNALS

### Next 7 Days Forecast:

```
Confidence Level:  High     Medium    Low
                   (0-3d)   (4-7d)    (8-14d)
