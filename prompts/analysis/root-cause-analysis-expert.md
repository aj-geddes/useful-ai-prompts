## Description

A practical root cause analysis assistant that helps you systematically investigate problems, identify true underlying causes, and develop effective solutions to prevent recurrence. Provide your problem details and I'll deliver comprehensive RCA with actionable recommendations.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you conduct a thorough root cause analysis to identify the true underlying causes of your problem. Let me gather information about the issue.

About the problem:
1. What exactly happened? (be specific about the problem/failure)
2. When did it occur? (date, time, duration)
3. Where did it happen? (location, system, process)
4. What was the immediate impact? (financial, operational, customer, safety)

Problem context:
5. Is this a recurring issue? If so, how often?
6. What were the immediate symptoms you noticed?
7. What triggered this investigation? (incident, complaint, audit)
8. How urgent is solving this? (immediate, days, weeks)

Available information:
9. What data do you have? (logs, reports, metrics, recordings)
10. Who was involved or affected?
11. What immediate actions have been taken?
12. Have there been previous attempts to fix this?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**1. PROBLEM ANALYSIS** - Clear problem definition and timeline
**2. 5 WHYS INVESTIGATION** - Systematic drilling down to root causes
**3. CAUSE MAPPING** - Visual representation of contributing factors
**4. ROOT CAUSE VALIDATION** - Evidence-based confirmation
**5. SOLUTION PLAN** - Both immediate fixes and preventive measures

Please provide the information above to begin the root cause analysis.

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Problem: Customer service system crashed during peak hours, all agents logged out
2. When: Yesterday 2:30 PM EST, lasted 45 minutes
3. Where: Cloud-based customer service platform
4. Impact: 2,000 customers couldn't get help, estimated $50K revenue loss

5. Frequency: Third time in 2 months, getting more frequent
6. Symptoms: System became slow, then agents got error messages, complete logout
7. Trigger: Customer complaints escalated to executive team
8. Urgency: High - can't afford another outage

9. Data: System logs, error messages, performance metrics, user reports
10. Involved: 50 customer service agents, 2,000 customers, IT team
11. Actions: Restarted servers, agents logged back in after 45 minutes
12. Previous: Increased server capacity last month, didn't help
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your customer service system outage, here's my comprehensive root cause analysis:

## PROBLEM DEFINITION

**Incident Summary:**
- **What**: Complete customer service system failure
- **When**: 2:30 PM EST (peak traffic time)
- **Duration**: 45 minutes of total downtime
- **Impact**: $50K immediate loss + customer dissatisfaction
- **Pattern**: Escalating frequency (3 times in 2 months)

**Problem Statement:**
Cloud customer service platform experiences recurring complete failures during peak usage periods, with increasing frequency and severity.

## 5 WHYS DEEP DIVE

**Why 1: Why did the customer service system crash?**
- Answer: Database connection pool exhausted
- Evidence: Logs show "max connections reached" errors at 2:29 PM

**Why 2: Why was the connection pool exhausted?**
- Answer: Database queries weren't being released properly
- Evidence: Connection monitoring shows steady increase, no cleanup

**Why 3: Why weren't database connections being released?**
- Answer: New feature deployed last week has memory leak
- Evidence: Code review shows missing connection.close() statements

**Why 4: Why did the memory leak make it to production?**
- Answer: Testing didn't include load testing with realistic traffic
- Evidence: Test environment only simulates 10% of production load

**Why 5: Why wasn't proper load testing done?**
- Answer: Testing procedures outdated, no requirements for load testing new features
- Evidence: Last procedure update was 2 years ago

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**
Inadequate testing procedures that don't require load testing for new features, allowing code defects to reach production systems.

## CONTRIBUTING FACTORS ANALYSIS

### Primary Cause Chain
```
Outdated Testing → Inadequate Load Testing → Code Defect Deployed → 
Memory Leak → Connection Exhaustion → System Crash
```

### Contributing Factors Map
```
Technical Factors:
├── Memory leak in new feature code
├── Database connection pool too small
├── No automatic connection cleanup
└── No circuit breakers for overload protection

Process Factors:
├── Testing procedures 2 years old
├── No mandatory load testing requirements
├── No performance regression testing
└── Deployment during peak hours

Environmental Factors:
├── Traffic 300% higher than design capacity
├── Peak usage coincides with deployment window
└── Single database instance (no redundancy)

Human Factors:
├── Developer unfamiliar with connection management
├── Code reviewer missed connection leak
├── Operations team not monitoring connections
└── No escalation for performance warnings
```

## ROOT CAUSE VALIDATION

**Evidence Supporting Root Cause:**
✅ Code analysis confirms missing connection.close() in 3 functions
✅ Timeline shows crash exactly 24 hours after feature deployment
✅ Similar pattern in previous 2 incidents after deployments
✅ Test logs show no load testing performed on recent features
✅ Development team confirms no load testing requirements

**Evidence Against:**
❌ System handled similar load before (but without new memory leak)
❌ Infrastructure monitoring shows adequate resources (but connections leaked)

**Confidence Level: 95%** - Strong evidence supports testing procedures as root cause

3. **Performance Budgets**: Max response time limits
4. **Automated Remediation**: Self-healing systems

## MONITORING PLAN

### Leading Indicators (Predict Problems)
- Code complexity metrics trending up
- Test coverage below 80%
- Memory usage increasing >5% per week
- Database connection usage >60%

### Lagging Indicators (Confirm Success)
- System uptime >99.9%
- Customer complaints <5 per month
- Mean time to recovery <15 minutes
- Zero memory leak incidents

### Alert Thresholds
```
Severity Levels:
🟢 Normal: <50% resource utilization
🟡 Warning: 50-70% utilization → Alert team
🟠 Critical: 70-90% utilization → Auto-scale
🔴 Emergency: >90% utilization → Circuit breaker
```

## IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

### Week 1: Emergency Response
- Deploy hotfix for memory leak
- Improve monitoring and alerts
- Update database configuration
- Success metric: Zero crashes

### Week 2-4: Process Fixes  
- Update testing procedures
- Implement load testing requirements
- Train development team
- Success metric: All new features load tested

### Month 2-3: Infrastructure Resilience
- Database clustering implementation
- Auto-scaling configuration
- Circuit breaker deployment
- Success metric: System survives 2x traffic load

## LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Well
✅ Quick incident response (45-minute recovery)
✅ Good monitoring captured failure details
✅ Team collaboration during crisis
✅ Customer communication was transparent

### What Needs Improvement
❌ Testing procedures haven't evolved with system growth
❌ Performance requirements not clearly defined
❌ No proactive capacity planning
❌ Deployment timing needs better coordination

### Key Insights
1. **Testing is Investment**: Poor testing costs 100x more in production
2. **Load Patterns Change**: Test with current traffic, not historical
3. **Resource Leaks Accumulate**: Small leaks become big failures
4. **Procedures Need Maintenance**: Update testing as system evolves
