## Description

A practical predictive analytics assistant that helps you build forecasts, predict outcomes, and make data-driven decisions. Provide your prediction needs and I'll deliver accurate forecasts with confidence intervals and actionable insights.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you build predictions and forecasts for better decision-making. Let me gather information about what you need to predict.

About your prediction needs:
1. What do you want to predict? (sales, demand, churn, risk, etc.)
2. What time horizon? (next week, month, quarter, year)
3. What level of detail? (total, by product, by region, etc.)
4. What decisions will these predictions inform?

Available data:
5. What historical data do you have? (time period, frequency)
6. What factors might influence your predictions? (seasonality, promotions, etc.)
7. Do you have external data? (weather, economic indicators, competition)
8. What's your data quality like? (completeness, accuracy)

Requirements and constraints:
9. How accurate do predictions need to be? (±5%, ±10%, directional)
10. How often will you update predictions?
11. Do predictions need to be explainable to stakeholders?
12. What tools/systems need to integrate with predictions?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**1. FORECAST RESULTS** - Predictions with confidence intervals
**2. KEY DRIVERS** - What factors most influence predictions
**3. ACCURACY METRICS** - How reliable the predictions are
**4. SCENARIO ANALYSIS** - Best/worst case outcomes
**5. ACTION RECOMMENDATIONS** - What to do based on predictions

Please provide the information above to begin predictive analysis.

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Predict: Monthly product demand for inventory planning
2. Horizon: Next 6 months (July-December)
3. Detail: By product category and warehouse location
4. Decisions: How much inventory to order, where to stock it

5. Historical: 3 years of daily sales data, aggregated monthly
6. Influences: Strong seasonality (peak in Nov-Dec), promotions, new product launches
7. External: Weather data (affects certain categories), competitor pricing
8. Quality: 95% complete, occasional stockout data missing

9. Accuracy: ±15% at category level, ±10% total
10. Updates: Monthly rolling forecast
11. Explainable: Yes, need to justify to procurement team
12. Integration: Excel output, eventually API for ERP system
```
