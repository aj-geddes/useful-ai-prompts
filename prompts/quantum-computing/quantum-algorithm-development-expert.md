## ALGORITHM DESIGN

### Quantum Portfolio Optimization Framework

**Core Algorithm: Modified QAOA for Portfolio Selection**
```
Mathematical Formulation:
Objective: Maximize expected return - λ × risk
Subject to: Σwᵢ = 1 (budget constraint)
           wᵢ ∈ {0, w_min, w_max} (discrete weights)

Quantum Encoding:
- Use 2 qubits per asset (4 weight levels: 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%)
- Total: 20 qubits for 10 major assets
- Remaining 7 qubits for constraint enforcement
```

**QAOA Circuit Architecture:**
```
Level 1: Problem Hamiltonian (HP)
├── Portfolio Return Term: Σᵢ μᵢ wᵢ
├── Risk Penalty Term: λ Σᵢⱼ wᵢ wⱼ σᵢⱼ
└── Budget Constraint: penalty(Σwᵢ - 1)²

Level 2: Mixer Hamiltonian (HM)
├── Asset Selection Mixer: X-rotations on asset qubits
├── Weight Distribution Mixer: Controlled rotations
└── Portfolio Rebalancing: Exchange gates between assets

Parameters: p=3 layers (β₁,γ₁), (β₂,γ₂), (β₃,γ₃)
Circuit Depth: ~75 gates (within your <100 constraint)
```

### Risk-Adjusted Cost Function
```python
def portfolio_cost_function(weights, returns, cov_matrix, risk_aversion=0.5):
    """
    Quantum-optimized cost function for portfolio selection
    """
    expected_return = np.dot(weights, returns)
    portfolio_variance = np.dot(weights, np.dot(cov_matrix, weights))
    
    # Quantum advantage: explore non-convex risk models
    tail_risk = compute_cvar(weights, returns, alpha=0.05)  # Quantum simulation
    
    return -(expected_return - risk_aversion * portfolio_variance - 0.1 * tail_risk)
```

## IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Qiskit Implementation Framework
```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister
from qiskit.algorithms.optimizers import COBYLA, SPSA
from qiskit.primitives import Estimator
import numpy as np

class QuantumPortfolioOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, n_assets=10, n_layers=3):
        self.n_assets = n_assets
        self.n_qubits = 2 * n_assets  # 2 qubits per asset for 4 weight levels
        self.n_layers = n_layers
        self.circuit = self._build_qaoa_circuit()
        
    def _build_qaoa_circuit(self):
        """Build QAOA circuit for portfolio optimization"""
        qc = QuantumCircuit(self.n_qubits)
        
        # Initial superposition
        qc.h(range(self.n_qubits))
        
        # QAOA layers
        for layer in range(self.n_layers):
            # Problem hamiltonian
            self._add_problem_hamiltonian(qc, f"gamma_{layer}")
            # Mixer hamiltonian  
            self._add_mixer_hamiltonian(qc, f"beta_{layer}")
            
        qc.measure_all()
        return qc
        
    def optimize(self, returns, cov_matrix, max_iterations=100):
        """Run quantum optimization"""
        
        def cost_function(params):
            # Execute quantum circuit with current parameters
            job = backend.run(self.circuit.assign_parameters(params))
            counts = job.result().get_counts()
            
            # Calculate expected portfolio performance
            return self._evaluate_portfolio(counts, returns, cov_matrix)
            
        # Classical optimization of quantum parameters
        optimizer = SPSA(maxiter=max_iterations)
        initial_params = np.random.random(2 * self.n_layers)
        
        result = optimizer.minimize(cost_function, initial_params)
        return self._extract_portfolio(result)
```

### Circuit Optimization Techniques
```
Gate Reduction Strategies:
1. Parameter Sharing: Use same angles for similar assets
   - Reduces parameters from 60 to ~20
   - Groups assets by sector/correlation

2. Approximate Compilation: Target specific IBM hardware
   - Native gate set optimization for IBM hardware
   - CNOT reduction using SWAP networks
   - Expected depth: 65 gates (vs 75 naive)

3. Error Mitigation: Zero-noise extrapolation
   - Run at multiple noise levels
   - Extrapolate to zero-noise limit
   - 20-30% accuracy improvement expected

Parameterization Strategy:
- Layer 1: Focus on individual asset selection
- Layer 2: Capture pairwise correlations  
- Layer 3: Global portfolio constraints
```

## PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

### Theoretical Complexity Analysis
```
Classical MIP Solver:
- Time: O(2^n) worst case for n assets

QAOA Portfolio Optimizer:

            classical_time = time.time() - start_time
            
            # Quantum approach
            start_time = time.time()
            quantum_portfolio = self.quantum_solver.optimize(scenario)
            quantum_time = time.time() - start_time
            
            # Performance comparison
            if quantum_portfolio.return > classical_portfolio.return:

## HARDWARE OPTIMIZATION

### IBM Quantum Platform Optimization
```
Hardware-Specific Optimizations:

1. Qubit Selection Strategy:
   - Use high-fidelity qubits (>99.5% single-qubit gate fidelity)
   - Minimize CNOT operations across distant qubits
   - Target qubits: [0,1,2,3,4,14,15,16,17,18] for minimal coupling

2. Circuit Transpilation:
   - Use Qiskit's SabreLayout for optimal qubit mapping
   - Apply dynamical decoupling during idle periods
   - Schedule parallel gates to minimize circuit depth

3. Error Mitigation Pipeline:
   Backend Calibration → Circuit Optimization → Error Mitigation
   ├── Daily: Readout error mitigation

    def __init__(self, backend):
        self.backend = backend
        self.calibration_data = self._get_backend_calibration()
        
    def adaptive_circuit_design(self, problem_size):
        """Design circuit based on current hardware performance"""
        
        # Adjust layers based on coherence time
        t_coherence = min(self.calibration_data['T1'])
        max_layers = int(t_coherence / self.estimate_layer_time())
        
        # Select optimal qubit subset
        qubit_ranking = self._rank_qubits_by_fidelity()
        selected_qubits = qubit_ranking[:problem_size]
