## AI SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE

### Real-Time Sepsis Detection System

**Core AI Architecture:**
```
Data Pipeline:
EHR/Monitoring → Feature Engineering → ML Pipeline → Risk Scoring → Clinical Alerts
   Systems           (Real-time)        (Ensemble)     (0-100)       (Tiered)

Components:
1. Data Integration Layer: HL7 FHIR APIs, real-time streaming
2. Feature Engineering: 85+ clinical variables, temporal patterns
3. ML Ensemble: Gradient boosting + neural network + clinical rules
4. Risk Stratification: Low (0-30), Medium (30-70), High (70-100)
5. Alert System: Smart notifications with clinical context
```

**Machine Learning Model Design:**
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
import joblib

class SepsisDetectionModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.feature_extractors = {
            'vital_signs': VitalSignsFeatures(),
            'lab_values': LabValueFeatures(), 
            'medications': MedicationFeatures(),
            'clinical_notes': NLPFeatures()
        }
        self.models = {
            'gb_model': GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=200),
            'nn_model': MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 50)),
            'clinical_rules': ClinicalRulesEngine()
        }
        
    def extract_features(self, patient_data, lookback_hours=6):
        """Extract features from patient data with temporal context"""
        features = {}
        
        # Vital signs trending (last 6 hours)
        features.update(self.feature_extractors['vital_signs'].extract(
            patient_data['vitals'], lookback_hours
        ))
        
        # Laboratory value changes
        features.update(self.feature_extractors['lab_values'].extract(
            patient_data['labs'], lookback_hours
        ))
        
        # Medication timing and dosages
        features.update(self.feature_extractors['medications'].extract(
            patient_data['medications'], lookback_hours
        ))
        
        return pd.DataFrame([features])
        
    def predict_sepsis_risk(self, patient_data):
        """Generate sepsis risk score with confidence intervals"""
        features = self.extract_features(patient_data)
        
        # Ensemble prediction
        gb_pred = self.models['gb_model'].predict_proba(features)[0, 1]
        nn_pred = self.models['nn_model'].predict_proba(features)[0, 1]
        rule_pred = self.models['clinical_rules'].evaluate(patient_data)
        
        # Weighted ensemble (empirically optimized weights)
        ensemble_score = 0.5 * gb_pred + 0.3 * nn_pred + 0.2 * rule_pred
        
        # Risk stratification
        risk_level = self.stratify_risk(ensemble_score)
        
        return {
            'risk_score': ensemble_score,
            'risk_level': risk_level,
            'contributing_factors': self.explain_prediction(features),
            'recommended_actions': self.generate_recommendations(risk_level)
        }
```

### Clinical Decision Support Integration
```
Alert System Architecture:

High Risk (Score 70-100):
├── Immediate Alert: ICU nurse station + physician mobile
├── EHR Banner: Red alert with sepsis protocol links
├── Auto-Documentation: Risk score in patient chart
└── Escalation: Intensivist notification if no response in 15 min

Medium Risk (Score 30-70):
├── Standard Alert: Nurse station notification
├── EHR Indicator: Yellow flag with trending data
└── Documentation: Risk score logged for monitoring

Low Risk (Score 0-30):
├── Background Monitoring: Continuous risk tracking
└── Trend Analysis: Flag if risk increases >20 points/hour
```

## CLINICAL INTEGRATION STRATEGY

### Workflow Integration Design

**ICU Nurse Workflow Enhancement:**
```
Current Workflow → Enhanced Workflow:

Hourly Assessment:
├── Manual vitals review → Automated risk scoring + vitals
├── Subjective evaluation → AI-supported clinical assessment  
├── Individual decision → Team-based risk stratification
└── Reactive care → Proactive sepsis prevention

Alert Response Protocol:
1. Receive AI alert with clinical context (30 seconds)
2. Review patient trend data and contributing factors (2 minutes)
3. Bedside assessment with AI-guided checklist (5 minutes)
4. Escalate to physician with AI summary if indicated (immediate)
5. Document assessment and actions taken (2 minutes)

Total time impact: +3-5 minutes per high-risk alert
Expected benefit: 30-minute reduction in sepsis recognition time
```

**Physician Dashboard Integration:**
```
Mobile App Features:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ICU Sepsis Dashboard - Dr. Smith          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 🔴 HIGH RISK: Room 302 (Score: 85)        │

│    ✓ Sepsis bundle initiated              │
│                                            │
│ 🟡 WATCH: Room 318 (Score: 45)            │
│    ↳ Temp trending up, BP stable          │
│                                            │
│ Current Patients: 12 | Avg Risk: 23       │
│ Sepsis Bundle Compliance: 94%             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Desktop EHR Integration:
- Risk score displayed prominently in patient header
