## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Current discipline: About 5/10 - I have good intentions but struggle with consistency
2. Areas needing discipline: Exercise routine, eating habits, work productivity, screen time
3. Failed goals: Regular exercise (start strong, fade after 2-3 weeks), eating healthier, finishing online courses
4. Main challenges: Social media scrolling, junk food when stressed, staying up too late watching Netflix
5. Easiest: Morning routines when I'm fresh. Hardest: Evenings when I'm tired or stressed

6. Want to build: Daily exercise, healthy eating, reading instead of scrolling, consistent sleep schedule
7. Immediate gratifications: Social media, comfort food, binge-watching shows, staying in bed
8. When I break commitments: Usually feel guilty, make excuses, then either give up or restart too ambitiously
9. Common excuses: "I'll start Monday," "Just this once," "I'm too stressed right now," "I don't have time"
10. Failure patterns: Start strong → hit rough patch → make excuses → abandon routine → feel guilty → restart

11. Strong discipline would enable: Better health, career advancement, personal projects completion, feeling proud
12. Daily habits: Morning workout, healthy meal prep, evening reading, consistent bedtime
13. Handle temptations: Want to pause and make conscious choices rather than reacting automatically
14. Accountability: Maybe workout partner, progress tracking, regular check-ins
15. Success: Consistent daily habits for 3+ months, feeling in control of choices, achieving health goals
```

**Assistant Output:**

I can see you understand what you need to do but struggle with the consistency gap that many people face. Your awareness of patterns is actually a strength we can build on. Here's your systematic self-discipline development plan:

## COMPREHENSIVE DISCIPLINE ASSESSMENT

### Your Discipline Profile Analysis

**Current Strengths to Leverage:**
```
PROVEN DISCIPLINE EVIDENCE:
✓ Strong morning routines when fresh (shows you CAN maintain discipline)
✓ Clear awareness of patterns and triggers (self-awareness is critical)
✓ Specific goals and vision for what discipline would enable
✓ History of strong starts (you have motivation and initial willpower)
✓ Recognition of excuse patterns (awareness allows change)

DISCIPLINE GAPS TO ADDRESS:
△ Evening willpower depletion (tired decision-making)
△ Stress-response patterns (comfort food, screen time)
△ All-or-nothing mindset (restart too ambitiously)
△ Consistency maintenance beyond initial motivation
△ Recovery from setbacks without complete abandonment
```

### The Discipline Failure Cycle - Breaking the Pattern

**Your Current Cycle:**
```
HIGH MOTIVATION START → INITIAL SUCCESS → ROUGH PATCH/STRESS → 
EXCUSE MAKING → ABANDONMENT → GUILT → OVER-AMBITIOUS RESTART

NEW DISCIPLINE CYCLE:
SUSTAINABLE START → EXPECTED CHALLENGES → PREPARED RESPONSES → 
MINOR ADJUSTMENTS → CONTINUED PROGRESS → MOMENTUM BUILDING
```

## WILLPOWER STRENGTHENING SYSTEM

### The 2% Discipline Building Method

**Sustainable Habit Formation:**
```
EXERCISE EXAMPLE:
Week 1-2: 5 minutes daily movement (walk around block)
Week 3-4: 10 minutes daily (add simple stretching)
Week 5-6: 15 minutes (light workout or longer walk)
Continue adding 5 minutes every 2 weeks until 30-45 minutes

SCREEN TIME MANAGEMENT:
Week 1-2: Read for 5 minutes before checking phone in morning
Week 3-4: Put phone in another room during meals
Week 5-6: No screens 30 minutes before bed
Continue building until full digital wellness system

SUCCESS PRINCIPLE: Consistency over intensity - 5 minutes daily beats 60 minutes twice weekly
```

### The PAUSE-EVALUATE-CHOOSE Method

**For In-the-Moment Temptations:**
```
PAUSE: When you feel the urge, stop and count to 10
- Take 3 deep breaths
- Physically step back from the temptation
- Remember this is a moment to practice discipline

EVALUATE: Ask yourself:
- "How will I feel about this choice in 2 hours?"
- "Does this align with who I'm trying to become?"
- "What would my best self do right now?"

CHOOSE: Make a conscious decision
- If you choose the temptation, do it mindfully (not automatically)
- If you choose the disciplined option, celebrate the win
- Either way, learn from the choice for next time

PRACTICE SCENARIOS:
- Reaching for phone instead of reading
- Wanting junk food when stressed
- Staying up late instead of going to bed
- Skipping workout when tired
```

## SUSTAINABLE DISCIPLINE BUILDING

### 8-Week Progressive Plan

**Week 1-2: FOUNDATION**
```
□ Choose ONE keystone habit: 5-minute morning movement
□ Practice PAUSE-EVALUATE-CHOOSE 3 times daily
□ Track habit with simple checkmark system
□ Forgive yourself for misses and restart next day
```

**Week 3-4: EXPANSION**
```
□ Add second small habit: 10-minute evening wind-down routine
□ Remove 1 temptation from environment (junk food or phone placement)
□ Practice "I'll do X for just 2 minutes" when motivation is low
□ Celebrate small wins daily
```

**Week 5-8: MOMENTUM & MASTERY**
```
□ Add third habit or expand existing ones slightly
□ Create accountability system (partner, app, or check-ins)
□ Develop "minimum viable habits" for bad days (2-minute versions)
□ Focus on identity: "I'm becoming someone who prioritizes health"
```

### Recovery Protocol When You Break Discipline

**Immediate Response (Within 1 hour):**
```
1. ACKNOWLEDGE: "I made a choice that didn't align with my goals"
2. LEARN: "What triggered this? What can I learn?"
3. RECOMMIT: "My next choice can be aligned with my goals"
4. ACT: Do one small positive action immediately

24-HOUR RECOVERY:
- Review what led to the lapse
- Adjust your system to prevent similar situations
- Restart immediately (don't wait for Monday)
- Focus on 80% consistency, not perfection
```

This systematic approach builds sustainable discipline by working with your natural patterns and energy levels rather than fighting against them.
