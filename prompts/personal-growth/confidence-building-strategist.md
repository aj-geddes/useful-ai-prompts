## Example Usage

### Input

"I am confident one-on-one but freeze up in group settings, especially meetings. Speaking in front of others makes me anxious and I rarely share my ideas even though I know they are good. This is limiting my career advancement because my contributions are not visible."

### Output

**Confidence Building Plan: Professional Visibility**

**1. Assessment**

Confidence profile:

- Strengths: One-on-one communication, idea generation, technical knowledge
- Gap areas: Group visibility, public speaking, self-advocacy
- Pattern: Confidence is present but suppressed by spotlight anxiety

Root cause analysis:

- Self-talk: "Others will judge me," "My ideas are not good enough to share"
- Physical: Anxiety response triggered by perceived group evaluation
- Behavioral: Avoidance pattern reinforcing the fear cycle
- Evidence gap: Limited recent positive experiences to counter the fear

**2. Strategy**

Core approach: Build evidence through graduated exposure while transforming self-talk.

Self-talk transformation:

- Current: "I will say something stupid and people will judge me"
- Reframe: "I have valuable insights; others are focused on content, not judging me"
- Evidence collection: Document positive responses when you do speak

Graduated challenge ladder:
| Level | Challenge | Goal |
|-------|-----------|------|
| 1 | Ask one clarifying question in small meeting | Get comfortable speaking |
| 2 | Share one prepared comment in team meeting | Practice delivering ideas |
| 3 | Volunteer for 5-minute update in larger meeting | Build presentation muscle |
| 4 | Lead discussion on topic of expertise | Establish presence |
| 5 | Present to larger group or leadership | Demonstrate visibility |

**3. Practice Plan**

Week 1-2: Foundation

- Daily: 2-minute morning confidence affirmation
- Meeting prep: Write down 2 potential contributions before each meeting
- Goal: Ask one question in at least 3 meetings
- Track: Note positive responses or absence of negative outcomes

Week 3-4: Building momentum

- Daily: Review evidence journal of successful contributions
- Meeting: Share one prepared comment per meeting
- Challenge: Volunteer for one small presentation opportunity
- Track: Document what you said and outcomes

Week 5-8: Expanding comfort zone

- Continue prepared contributions, increasing spontaneity
- Seek feedback from trusted colleague: "How did my contribution land?"
- Present in team setting with prepared material
- Celebrate: Acknowledge growth regardless of perfection

**4. Sustainability**

Daily practices:

- Morning: Read confidence affirmation, visualize successful participation
- Pre-meeting: Review prepared talking points
- Post-meeting: Add to evidence journal (what went well)
- Evening: Self-compassion for any perceived mistakes (reframe as learning)

Monthly review:

- How has participation increased?
- What situations are now comfortable that were not before?
- What is the next challenge level to target?

Setback protocol:

- One bad experience does not erase evidence of growth
- Return to previous challenge level if needed
- Focus on effort and courage, not just outcomes

Expected progression:

- Month 1: Regular question-asking, occasional prepared comments
- Month 2: Consistent meeting contributions, first presentation
- Month 3: Natural participation, actively seeking visibility opportunities
- Month 6: Confident group presence, pursuing advancement opportunities
