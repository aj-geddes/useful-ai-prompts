## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Values clarity: Not very clear - maybe 4/10. I know some things matter to me but couldn't articulate core values clearly
2. Top 5 values: Family, success, honesty... but I'm not sure what success really means to me
3. Action alignment: Poor - probably 5/10. I often do things I feel I "should" do rather than what feels right
4. Most authentic: When I'm helping my younger sister with her problems, or working on creative projects alone
5. Values conflicts: Always torn between wanting financial security and wanting creative freedom

6. Meaningful experiences: Teaching my sister to drive, finishing a painting, volunteering at animal shelter, deep conversations with close friends
7. Energizing activities: Creating art, solving problems for people I care about, learning new skills, being in nature
8. Frustration: When I spend all day on work I don't care about, when I avoid difficult conversations, when I waste time on social media
9. People I admire: My art teacher who left a corporate job to teach, my neighbor who always helps others, friends who travel
10. Legacy/impact: I want to inspire creativity in others and help people feel less alone in their struggles
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your responses, I can see you have strong natural values that have been suppressed by external expectations. Here's your comprehensive values clarification framework:

## COMPREHENSIVE VALUES EXPLORATION

### Your Authentic Core Values:
```
PRIMARY CORE VALUES:

1. CREATIVITY - Deep fulfillment through artistic expression and creative problem-solving
   Evidence: Energized by art, teaching moments, problem-solving for others
   Current state: Limited to personal time, not integrated into life structure
   
2. CONNECTION & SERVICE - Meaningful relationships and helping others grow
   Evidence: Fulfillment from helping sister, deep conversations, teaching, volunteering
   Current state: Strong in close relationships, limited in broader contexts
   
3. AUTHENTICITY - Living true to yourself rather than external expectations
   Evidence: Frustration with "should" decisions, desire to stop living others' life
   Current state: SUPPRESSED - Major source of current life dissatisfaction
   
4. GROWTH & LEARNING - Continuous development and skill acquisition
   Evidence: Energized by learning new skills, helping others learn and grow
   
5. NATURE & BEAUTY - Connection to natural world and aesthetic experiences
   Evidence: Energized by nature, artistic pursuits, creative expression
```

### The CREATIVE Decision-Making Framework:
```
C - CREATIVITY CHECK: Does this allow for creative expression?
R - RELATIONSHIP ASSESSMENT: How does this impact meaningful connections?
E - ENERGY EVALUATION: Will this energize or drain me long-term?
A - AUTHENTICITY ALIGNMENT: Is this true to who I really am?
T - TRUTH AND GROWTH: Does this support my development?
I - INTEGRATION POTENTIAL: How can I honor multiple values?
V - VISION CONNECTION: Does this move me toward my desired life?
E - EVALUATION: How will I know if this choice is working?
```
