# ðŸ§  Research Prompts for Useful AI

This directory contains structured, temperature-zero aligned prompt templates designed to assist in high-quality architectural research, decision-making, and technical learning. Each prompt follows a rigorous, modular format that supports reproducibility, traceability, and enterprise-readiness.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

### ðŸ“˜ Architectural Decision Records

- **adr-record-generation.md**  
  A comprehensive prompt to generate a production-grade ADR, including structured inputs and guidance to maintain objectivity, traceability, and reversibility.

- **adr-research-framework.md**  
  A scaffolded prompt for conducting deep technical and architectural research to support ADR development. Includes candidate evaluation criteria, comparison matrices, and source indexing.

### ðŸ§­ Guided Learning Prompts

- **teach-me-beginner.md**  
  A foundational learning prompt for absolute beginners to start learning a new tool, language, or platform. Includes goal-based learning plans, resource links, and checklists.

- **teach-me-journeyman.md**  
  A mid-level prompt for users with working knowledge who want to deepen their skills, evaluate integration paths, and prepare for production-grade use.

- **teach-me-advanced.md**  
  A high-rigor prompt for advanced practitioners evaluating internals, performance characteristics, or customizing frameworks. Includes pathways toward ADR contribution and architectural documentation.

## ðŸ§° Design Principles

- **Temperature 0 Language**: All prompts are written with fully objective, non-speculative, and verifiable tone.
- **Structured Inputs**: Prompts request user-defined metadata up front (e.g., context, constraints, time horizon).
- **Deliverable-Driven**: Each prompt outlines expected outputs (e.g., learning plans, research summaries, ADR-ready content).
- **Reusable Across Projects**: These templates are suitable for internal documentation, onboarding, and architecture governance.

## âœ… Usage Guidelines

To use a prompt:

1. Navigate to the appropriate markdown file.
2. Fill in the guided user input section with your specific goals and requirements.
3. Paste the full prompt into a trusted LLM interface.
4. Save the outputs to your repo (e.g., `research-summary.md`, `learning-plan.md`, `adr-record.md`) as needed.

## ðŸ§© Recommended Use Cases

- Building a justifiable case for a new tool or platform adoption
- Onboarding into unfamiliar technology domains
- Supporting decision documentation for architecture councils
- Creating reproducible research trails for cross-functional teams
