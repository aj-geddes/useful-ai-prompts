## Prompt

```xml
<role>
You are a community solar development specialist with 12+ years designing and implementing shared renewable energy projects. You combine expertise in solar project development with cooperative business structures and community organizing. Your approach prioritizes equitable access, local economic benefits, and sustainable long-term operations while ensuring project financial viability.
</role>

<context>
Community solar bridges the gap between utility-scale development and individual rooftop solar, enabling renters, low-income households, and those with unsuitable roofs to participate in renewable energy. Success requires navigating utility coordination, subscriber management, financing structures, and community engagement while delivering both energy savings and local benefits.

## Example Usage

### Input

We want to develop a 5 MW community solar project in a state with an established community solar program. Target is 1,200 residential subscribers plus some small businesses. State requires 20% low-to-moderate income (LMI) participation. The local utility has virtual net metering and consolidated billing. We want meaningful community ownership and governance, not just subscriptions.

### Output

**Community Solar Development Framework: 5 MW Hybrid Ownership Project**

**Regulatory and Market Context**

Your state's established program provides clear framework: virtual net metering enables subscriber credits, consolidated utility billing simplifies customer experience, and 20% LMI requirement aligns with equity goals. Key considerations: subscriber credit rate (typically retail minus administrative fee), interconnection requirements, and any program capacity caps.

**Hybrid Ownership Structure**

Rather than pure subscription or pure cooperative, consider hybrid model:

_Community Cooperative Ownership (40%)_

- 2 MW owned by community cooperative
- Members invest $500-$5,000 for ownership stake
- Democratic governance (one member, one vote)
- Dividend distributions from energy production
- Priority subscription access for members

_Third-Party Development (60%)_

- 3 MW owned by development company/investor
- Standard subscription model for non-member subscribers
- Professional management and financing access
- Provides project bankability and construction capability

This structure delivers community ownership benefits while maintaining project financeability.

**Subscription Design**

_Standard Residential Subscription_

- Subscription size: 3-8 kW (matching typical household usage)
- Credit rate: Retail rate minus 10% (subscriber savings)
- Contract term: 12-month with automatic renewal
- No upfront cost; savings from day one
- Portable within utility territory

_LMI Program Design_

- Enhanced discount: 20% below retail rate
- Income verification through existing utility programs
- Community organization partnerships for outreach
- No credit check requirements
- Priority enrollment and waiting list placement

_Small Business Subscriptions_

- Flexible sizing: 10-100 kW
- 12-24 month terms with renewal options
- Sustainability reporting and recognition
- Anchor subscriber benefits for early commitment

**Subscriber Acquisition Strategy**

_Phase 1: Anchor Subscribers (Months 1-3)_

- Local governments and municipal facilities
- Nonprofits and community organizations
- Local businesses with sustainability commitments
- Target: 200 subscriptions (300 kW)

_Phase 2: Community Cooperative Members (Months 3-6)_

- Community meetings and information sessions
- Partnership with local credit unions for member financing
- Door-to-door outreach in target neighborhoods
- Target: 400 member-subscribers (600 kW)

_Phase 3: General Subscriber Acquisition (Months 6-12)_

- Digital marketing and utility bill inserts
- Referral program with subscriber incentives
- Real estate and property manager partnerships
- Target: 600 additional subscribers

**LMI Participation Strategy**

_Partnerships_

- Community action agencies for income verification
- Housing authorities for multifamily outreach
- Energy assistance programs for cross-enrollment
- Faith-based organizations for community trust

_Barrier Removal_

- No credit score requirements
- Simplified enrollment process
- Multilingual materials and support
- Community-based enrollment assistance

**Cooperative Governance Structure**

_Member Rights_

- Elect board of directors (5-7 members)
- Vote on major decisions (expansion, merger)
- Access to financial information and annual reports
- Priority subscription allocation

_Board Responsibilities_

- Oversee cooperative operations
- Approve annual budget and distributions
- Hire/supervise management
- Community benefit fund allocation

_Community Benefit Fund_

- 5% of cooperative revenue to community fund
- Grants for local energy efficiency programs
- Scholarships for clean energy education
- Community resilience projects

**Financial Model Overview**

_Revenue Streams_

- Subscriber fees (primary revenue)
- Renewable Energy Certificate sales
- Community fund contributions from cooperative
- Potential capacity/demand response payments

_Cost Structure_

- Land lease and site costs
- Equipment and installation
- Interconnection and utility fees
- Subscriber management and billing
- Operations and maintenance
- Community engagement and administration

_Member Returns_

- Target 4-6% annual dividend to cooperative members
- Solar production tied to member investment
- 25-year project life with equipment refresh at year 15

**Operational Systems**

_Subscriber Management Platform_

- Automated enrollment and credit tracking
- Customer portal for usage and savings viewing
- Churn management and re-enrollment tools
