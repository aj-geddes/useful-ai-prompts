- Style: Tends toward indirect communication
- Goal: Balance assertiveness with warmth
- Priority area: Difficult conversations
- Learning approach: Practice-based with scripts

## Example Usage

### Input
I rate my communication 6/10. I'm good at listening but struggle with being direct. I avoid difficult conversations and hint instead of asking clearly. This affects both work (with my boss) and personal life (with my partner). I want to express needs without seeming demanding.

### Output

**Communication Enhancement Plan: From Indirect to Clear**

**Your Communication Profile**
Strengths: Strong listening skills, natural empathy, relationship-focused approach
Growth area: Direct expression of needs, preferences, and boundaries
Core pattern to shift: Replacing hints with clear requests

**Core Technique: The Direct Request Formula**
Transform hints into clear requests using this structure:
"I [feel/think] when [situation] because [reason]. I need/would like [specific request]."

This formula ensures clarity while maintaining warmth through emotional context.

**Before/After Transformation Examples**

*Requesting Help at Home*
- Hint: "The dishes are piling up again..."
- Direct: "Would you be able to do the dishes tonight? I'd really appreciate the help."

*Expressing Disagreement at Work*
- Hint: "I guess that could work..." (when you actually disagree)
- Direct: "I see it differently. Can I share my perspective?"

*Setting Work Boundaries*
- Hint: "I'm pretty busy lately..."
- Direct: "I can't take on that project right now, but I could help with X instead."

*Stating a Preference*
- Hint: "We could go anywhere for dinner..."
- Direct: "I'd really like Italian tonight. Does that work for you?"

**Weekly Practice Plan**

*Week 1: Direct Requests*
Make 3 direct requests instead of hints daily. Track how people respond. You will likely notice they respond positively to clarity.

*Week 2: Stating Preferences*
Practice "I prefer..." and "I'd like..." statements in low-stakes situations (restaurants, movie choices, scheduling).

*Week 3: Expressing Disagreement*
Use "I see it differently" or "I have a different perspective" once daily in situations where you would normally stay silent.

*Week 4: Difficult Conversations*
Apply all techniques to one previously-avoided conversation. Prepare using the Direct Request Formula.

**Scripts for Your Boss Context**
- "I'd like to discuss my workload and priorities. When would be a good time?"
- "I need clarity on which project takes precedence so I can plan my week."
- "I want to make sure we're aligned on expectations for this deadline."
- "I have a concern about [X]. Can we discuss it?"

**Scripts for Your Partner Context**
- "I need some time to decompress when I get home before we talk about the day. Is 30 minutes okay?"
- "I'd like us to decide this together rather than me just going along."
- "I feel disconnected when we don't check in. Can we set aside 10 minutes tonight to talk?"
- "This is important to me. I need you to hear me out before responding."

**Managing the "Demanding" Fear**
- Direct communication is respectful communication. It respects others' time and intelligence.
- People genuinely prefer knowing what you actually need. Guessing is exhausting.
- Clarity prevents the resentment that builds from unmet, unexpressed needs.
- Tone creates the difference: calm and clear reads as assertive, not aggressive.

**Recovery Phrase for Mistakes**
When you catch yourself hinting: "Let me try that again more directly. What I'm actually asking is..."

**Progress Indicators (Track Weekly)**
- Others understand your needs without requiring clarification
- Fewer misunderstandings and unmet expectations
- Reduced anxiety about expressing preferences
- Relationships feel more authentic and balanced
- You spend less mental energy crafting hints
