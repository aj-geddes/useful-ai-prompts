## Example Usage

### Input

I'm a senior individual contributor at a tech company. My challenge is communicating with my manager who is very busy and often seems distracted in our 1:1s. I also need to influence decisions made by my peers even though I don't have authority over them. I want to be seen as a leader even without the title.

### Output

**Workplace Communication Strategy: Influence Without Authority**

**Manager Communication**

_Problem: Distracted manager in 1:1s_
Your manager is likely overwhelmed. Make it easy for them to engage with you.

_Before 1:1s_
Send a brief agenda 2 hours before:
"For our 1:1, I'd like to cover:

1. [Project] - Need your input on X
2. Quick update on [Initiative]
3. One question about my development"

_During 1:1s_

- Start with what's most important (they may get pulled away)
- Be concise: Lead with the point, then add context if needed
- Use explicit asks: "I need you to [decide/approve/introduce me to]"
- Take notes visibly; it signals importance

_When They Seem Distracted_

- "I can see you're juggling a lot. What would be most helpful to focus on today?"
- "Should we reschedule so I can have your full attention for this?"
- "I'll keep this brief. The one thing I need from you is..."

**Peer Influence Without Authority**

_Foundation: Build Relationship First_
Before you need to influence, deposit into the relationship:

- Help them when you can without expecting return
- Show genuine interest in their work and challenges
- Give credit publicly for their contributions

_Making Your Case_
Frame proposals in terms of their interests:

- "I think this could help with [their priority/problem]"
- "You mentioned struggling with X. This approach might address that."
- "What concerns would you have about trying this?"

_When You Disagree_

- "I see it differently. Can I share my perspective?"
- "Help me understand your reasoning there."
- "What if we tried [alternative] and evaluated after [timeframe]?"

_When You Need Buy-In_

- Bring them in early, not after you've decided
- Ask for input: "What am I missing here?"
- Let them contribute to the solution
- Give them ownership: "Would you be willing to lead the [aspect] of this?"

**Being Seen as a Leader**

_Visibility Strategies_

- Volunteer to present team updates to leadership
- Summarize complex discussions and propose next steps in meetings
- Mentor junior team members (even informally)
- Share insights and resources that help others

_Communication Presence_

- Speak in meetings, even briefly. Silence makes you invisible.
- Use confident language: "I recommend" not "Maybe we could"
- Own your expertise: "Based on my experience with X..."
- Ask strategic questions that show big-picture thinking

_In Meetings_

- Prepare one insightful comment or question
- Build on others' points: "Expanding on what Sarah said..."
- Summarize and synthesize: "So what I'm hearing is three options..."
- Volunteer for action items (selectively)

**Email Communication**

_To Busy Leaders_

- Subject line: Clear action needed
- First line: The ask or key point
- Body: Brief context
- Close: Specific next step

Example:
"Subject: Decision needed on X by Friday

Hi [Manager],

I need your approval on [specific thing] by Friday to stay on timeline for [project].

The key tradeoff is [brief context]. I recommend [option] because [reason].

Let me know if you'd prefer to discuss or if I should proceed."

**Week-by-Week Implementation**

- Week 1: Start sending 1:1 agendas in advance
- Week 2: Practice concise communication (point first, context second)
- Week 3: Focus on one peer relationship to strengthen
- Week 4: Speak up once in each meeting attended
