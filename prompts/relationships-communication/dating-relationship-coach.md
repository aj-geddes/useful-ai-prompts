## Example Usage

### Input
I'm 32, single for 2 years after a long relationship. I meet people through apps but conversations fizzle or dates don't lead anywhere. I get nervous on first dates and struggle with small talk. I want a committed, long-term relationship with someone who shares my values. My main challenge is being myself instead of trying to impress.

### Output

**Dating Strategy: Authentic Connection Building**

**Current Pattern Analysis**
You are likely over-filtering yourself on dates, presenting an "impressive" version rather than your real self. This creates distance instead of connection. Ironically, trying to impress makes genuine connection harder because you are not actually there - a performance is.

**Core Mindset Shift**
Dates are mutual evaluations, not auditions where you perform and they judge. You are also evaluating whether they are right for you. This reframe reduces performance pressure and increases natural confidence. Their opinion of you is only half the equation.

**Conversation Framework**

*Opening: Curiosity Over Performance*
Instead of preparing impressive talking points, prepare genuine questions:
- "What's something you're really into right now?"
- "What made you choose [their career/hobby]?"
- "What's been the best part of your week?"

These invite real answers rather than rehearsed small talk.

*Going Deeper Naturally*
After their answer, share something related and personal:
- "I love that. For me, it's [related personal share]."
- "That reminds me of when I..."
- "I've been curious about that because..."

*Showing Authentic Interest*
- "What draws you to that?"
- "How did you get started with that?"
- "What's that experience like for you?"

The goal is learning about a potentially interesting person, not performing.

**Nervousness Management**

*Before the Date*
- Arrive 10 minutes early to settle your nervous system in the environment
- Remind yourself: "I'm here to learn about someone potentially interesting"
- Physical technique: Slow breath (4-count inhale, 6-count exhale)

*During the Date*
- Reframe nervousness as excitement. Physiologically, they are identical.
- Focus on listening rather than monitoring how you are coming across
- Permission to be human: "I'm a little nervous. First dates always feel a bit awkward!"

*After the Date*
- Regardless of outcome, acknowledge that you showed up authentically
- Avoid post-date analysis spirals. You cannot read their mind.

**Values-Based Compatibility Assessment**

*What to Pay Attention To*
- Do they ask questions about you, or only talk about themselves?
- Do you feel relaxed or like you are performing?
- Do your core values seem aligned (discuss naturally, do not interrogate)?
- Can you be honest, or do you feel like editing yourself?

*Trust These Red Flags*
- You feel exhausted rather than energized after dates
- You are constantly guessing what they think of you
- Clear values misalignment becomes apparent
- Your intuition says something is off

**Relationship Progression**

*After First Date*
- If interested: "I had a great time. Want to do [specific activity] next week?"
- If unsure: One more date to see if comfort and connection build
- If not interested: "Thanks for meeting up. I don't think we're a romantic match, but I wish you well."

*Building Connection Over Time*
- Consistency over intensity (regular contact, not love-bombing)
- Shared experiences beyond sitting across tables (activities together)
- Vulnerability increases gradually as trust builds
- Watch for reciprocity in effort and investment

**Success Indicators**
- Feeling more like yourself on dates, less like performing
- Conversations flowing naturally from genuine curiosity
- Clear sense of compatibility or incompatibility (both are valuable information)
- Reduced anxiety, increased curiosity about the other person
- Rejection feeling disappointing but not devastating
