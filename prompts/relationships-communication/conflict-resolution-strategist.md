## Example Usage

### Input

3-month ongoing tension with coworker over project responsibilities and communication. She went to our boss without talking to me first. We're equal level but she has more tenure, I have specific technical expertise. Small startup, informal culture, manager is conflict-avoidant. Major project deadline in 6 weeks. I want respectful working relationship and clear communication.

### Output

**Conflict Resolution Strategy: Peer Workplace Tension**

**Conflict Analysis**

_Root Causes Identified_

1. Communication breakdown: Direct conversation avoidance has escalated tension
2. Authority ambiguity: Startup informality creates unclear decision-making boundaries
3. Different operational styles: Your collaborative approach vs. her hierarchical approach
4. Trust breach: Going to boss without direct conversation damaged trust
5. Unmet needs: Your need for respect/equality, her likely need for recognition/security

_Underlying Dynamics_

- Her tenure may create expectation of informal seniority
- Your technical expertise may feel threatening to her established position
- Manager's conflict avoidance enables escalation rather than resolution
- Project deadline creates pressure that amplifies tensions

**Strategic Approach**

_Phase 1: Internal Preparation_

- Regulate your emotions before any conversation (you cannot de-escalate if escalated)
- Clarify your interests: respect, collaborative communication, project success, working relationship
- Anticipate her interests: recognition for experience, security, validation of her approach
- Prepare to listen first, advocate second

_Phase 2: Initiate Resolution Conversation_
Opening: "Sarah, I'd like to improve how we work together. I value your experience and want our project to succeed. Can we set aside 30-45 minutes to talk about our collaboration?"

If she's reluctant: "I know we've had some tension. I'd like to understand your perspective and find a way forward that works for both of us."

**Conversation Framework**

_Opening (5 minutes)_
"I realize we've had some friction. I want to understand your perspective and share mine so we can work together more effectively. I'm committed to finding a solution."

_Listen First Phase (15 minutes)_
Key questions:

- "What would help you feel most supported in this project?"
- "How do you prefer to make decisions when we disagree on approach?"
- "What are your main concerns about how we've been working together?"

Technique: Reflect back before responding. "What I'm hearing is..." Resist defending until you fully understand.

_Share Your Perspective Phase (10 minutes)_
"I felt caught off guard when the approach disagreement went to [boss] before we could discuss it. What I need is for us to talk through concerns directly first. I want us to be able to disagree and work it out together."

Avoid blame: Focus on behavior and impact, not character or intent.

_Problem-Solve Together Phase (15 minutes)_

- "What would ideal collaboration look like for you?"
- "I'm willing to [specific adjustment] if you're open to [specific adjustment]."
- "Should we establish some ground rules for how we communicate about disagreements?"

**De-escalation Phrases for Heated Moments**

- "Help me understand your perspective on this."
- "I can see this is important to you. Tell me more."
- "Let's focus on finding something that works for both of us."
- "What would need to happen for you to feel comfortable with this?"
- "I hear you. Let me think about that before responding."

**Potential Agreement Options**

- Weekly 15-minute alignment sync on project decisions
- Clear agreement: discuss concerns directly before involving manager
- Explicit division: "You own X-type decisions, I own Y-type decisions"
- Two-week trial with scheduled check-in to assess progress

**Follow-Through Plan**

- Week 1: Implement agreements with visible consistency
- Week 2: First check-in conversation to assess and adjust
- Weeks 3-4: Refine approach based on what's working
- Ongoing: Address any new friction within 24 hours before it accumulates

**Relationship Repair Indicators**

- Direct conversations replacing indirect tension
- Proactive information sharing in both directions
- Ability to build on each other's ideas in meetings
- Team members noticing improved collaboration
- You both feeling less stressed about the working relationship

**If Resolution Stalls**

- Propose involving manager as facilitator, not judge
- Suggest external mediator if available
- Focus on minimum viable working agreement for project completion
- Document agreements in writing to prevent future confusion
