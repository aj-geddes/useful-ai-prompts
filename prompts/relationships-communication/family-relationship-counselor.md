## Example Usage

### Input
Tension with my mother who is critical of my parenting choices. Every visit becomes stressful. She makes comments about my kids' behavior, my discipline approach, and my work-life balance. I want to maintain the relationship for my kids' sake but need the criticism to stop. My father usually stays silent during these moments.

### Output
**Family Relationship Strategy: Managing Critical Parent**

**Dynamic Analysis**
Your mother's criticism likely stems from: anxiety about her grandchildren, different generational parenting norms, and possibly her own sense of diminished role. Your father's silence enables the pattern. Understanding doesn't excuse it, but helps strategize.

**Pre-Visit Preparation**

*Set Internal Boundaries*
Decide in advance what you will and won't engage with:
- Will address: Direct criticism of your children in front of them
- Will redirect: Unsolicited parenting advice
- Will ignore: Sighs, looks, and passive commentary

*Prime the Conversation*
Before visits, call ahead:
"Mom, I'm looking forward to seeing you. I want our visits to be enjoyable for everyone. I'm asking that we avoid discussing parenting approaches while you're here. Can we agree to that?"

**In-the-Moment Responses**

*For Direct Criticism*
Calm, firm, brief:
- "I've got this, Mom."
- "We do it differently, and that's okay."
- "I appreciate your concern. I'm handling it."

*For Persistent Comments*
Set the boundary:
- "Mom, I've asked you not to comment on my parenting. If it continues, we'll need to cut the visit short."
- "This isn't open for discussion."

*For Criticism in Front of Kids*
Address immediately:
- "Kids, Grandma and I see things differently sometimes. In our house, we [your approach]."
- To Mom: "Let's discuss this privately later."

**Engaging Your Father**
He may be an ally if approached right:
- Privately: "Dad, when Mom criticizes my parenting, it makes visits hard. It would help if you could redirect the conversation."
- Give him specific language: "Something like 'Let's just enjoy the grandkids.'"

**Long-Term Strategy**

*Shorter, More Frequent Visits*
Reduce pressure: 2-hour visits are easier to manage than weekend stays.

*Create Positive Experiences*
Plan activities during visits so there's less unstructured criticism time.

*Acknowledge What Works*
When she's supportive, name it: "I love how you read to the kids, Mom. They adore that time with you."

**Protecting Your Children**
- Don't let criticism happen unchallenged in front of them
- Privately explain to age-appropriate kids: "Grandma grew up differently, so she has different ideas"
- Model healthy boundary-setting for them

**Realistic Expectations**
Your mother may not change completely. Success is:
- Fewer critical comments
- Your ability to redirect without anxiety
- Visits that don't leave you depleted
- Kids having positive grandparent relationship despite challenges

**If Boundaries Are Repeatedly Violated**
- Reduce visit frequency
- Shorten visit duration
- Meet in neutral locations
- Take breaks from contact if needed
