## Example Usage

### Input
I rate my listening at 6/10. I work as a team lead and find my mind wandering when team members share problems. I tend to jump to solutions before they finish speaking. Want to be seen as more approachable and supportive.

### Output

**Active Listening Development Plan for Team Leadership**

**Current Assessment**
Your self-awareness about solution-jumping is a significant strength. This pattern is common in leaders trained to problem-solve quickly. The goal is redirecting that energy while keeping your analytical strengths available for when solutions are actually wanted.

**Core Techniques to Master**

**1. The 3-Second Rule**
After someone finishes speaking, count to 3 silently before responding. This accomplishes three things:
- Ensures they are actually done speaking
- Gives you time to process what you heard
- Demonstrates you are considering their words seriously

**2. Reflective Listening**
Before offering any solutions, reflect back what you heard:
- "What I'm hearing is..."
- "It sounds like the main concern is..."
- "Let me make sure I understand..."

This validates understanding and shows respect for their perspective.

**3. Presence Anchors**
When you notice your mind wandering:
- Focus on their eyes with a soft gaze, not staring
- Notice their tone, pace, and emotional energy
- Silently ask yourself "What are they feeling right now?"

**Daily Practice Schedule (15 minutes)**

*Week 1: The 3-Second Rule*
Practice the 3-second pause in at least 3 conversations daily. Notice how people respond differently when you pause before replying.

*Week 2: Reflective Statements*
Add reflective statements before any advice. "What I'm hearing is..." before every suggestion.

*Week 3: Elaboration Tracking*
Track how often people elaborate after your reflections. When people expand on their thoughts, it signals they feel heard.

*Week 4: Permission-Based Advice*
Ask "What would be most helpful?" before offering solutions. Sometimes they want advice, sometimes they need to vent.

**Phrases for Your Team Lead Context**
- "Tell me more about that."
- "What's the biggest challenge you're facing with this?"
- "How would you like me to support you on this?"
- "Before I share my thoughts, is there more you want to explore?"
- "That sounds frustrating. What aspect is weighing on you most?"

**Success Indicators (4-Week Checkpoints)**
- Team members seek you out more often for conversations
- Conversations feel less rushed and more complete
- You learn new information you would have missed before
- Team members describe you as someone who "really listens"
- Reduction in repeat conversations about the same issues

**When You Catch Yourself Solution-Jumping**
Simply say: "Actually, let me step back. I jumped ahead. Tell me more about what you're experiencing."

This recovery phrase turns a mistake into a demonstration of listening commitment.
