## Example Usage

### Input

I have a 4-year-old who throws tantrums when she doesn't get her way, especially in public. Time-outs don't seem to work. I try to stay calm but sometimes lose my patience. My partner and I disagree on how strict to be. I want to be loving but also need her to listen.

### Output

**Parenting Strategy: Managing Preschooler Tantrums**

**Understanding the Behavior**
At 4, emotional regulation is still developing. Tantrums aren't defiance; they're overwhelm. Her brain literally can't manage big feelings yet. Your job: Help her build that skill, not punish her for lacking it.

**Why Time-Outs May Not Work**
Traditional time-outs isolate during emotional crisis. For many kids, this increases distress rather than teaching regulation. Consider "time-ins" instead.

**In-the-Moment Approach**

_Step 1: Stay Calm (This is the hardest part)_

- Your calm is contagious. Your escalation is too.
- Deep breath. Lower your voice.
- Get on her physical level.

_Step 2: Acknowledge the Feeling_
"You're really upset that you can't have that toy. It's hard when we want something and can't have it."

_Step 3: Hold the Boundary_
"I hear you, and the answer is still no. I'm here with you while you feel sad about it."

_Step 4: Offer Choices Within Limits_
"You can't have the toy, but you can choose: do you want to walk or do you need me to carry you to the car?"

**Public Tantrum Strategy**

- Prepare in advance: "If you have a big meltdown, we'll leave and try again another time"
- When it happens: Calmly leave. No lectures. Just matter-of-fact departure.
- Afterward: "That was hard. Next time, let's try to use words when you're upset."

**Preventing Tantrums**

_Transition Warnings_
"In 5 minutes, we're leaving the playground. Start thinking about one last thing you want to do."

_Hunger/Tired Prevention_
Most 4-year-old meltdowns happen when hungry, tired, or overstimulated. Snacks and naps prevent more tantrums than any discipline strategy.

_Choices Throughout the Day_
Give small choices to build sense of control: "Red shirt or blue shirt?" "Apple or banana?" This reduces power struggles later.

**Getting on the Same Page with Your Partner**

_Have a Separate Conversation_
Not during or after tantrums. Pick a calm time.

_Find Common Ground_
"We both want her to behave better. Let's agree on one consistent approach to try for two weeks, then evaluate."

_Agree on Basics_

- We stay calm (even when she doesn't)
- We acknowledge feelings AND hold boundaries
- We back each other up in the moment, discuss differences later
- We don't undermine each other in front of her

**Language to Use**

_Instead of:_ "Stop crying right now!"
_Try:_ "I see you're having big feelings. I'm here."

_Instead of:_ "If you don't stop, we're leaving!"
_Try:_ "When you calm down, we can talk about what you want."

_Instead of:_ "You're being so bad!"
_Try:_ "That behavior isn't okay. Let's try again."

**Signs of Progress (This Takes Time)**

- Tantrums shorter in duration
- She starts using words during frustration
- She can sometimes self-soothe with your guidance
- Fewer public meltdowns

**For You**

- It's okay to lose patience sometimes. Repair matters.
- "I got frustrated and yelled. I'm sorry. Let me try that again."
- Modeling repair teaches her more than perfect parenting ever could.
