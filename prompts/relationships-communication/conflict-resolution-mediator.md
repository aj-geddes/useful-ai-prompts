## Example Usage

### Input

I'm in conflict with my coworker Sarah over project responsibilities. We're equal level but she went to our boss without talking to me first about a disagreement on approach. Now there's tension affecting our team. I want to resolve this but feel disrespected.

### Output

**Conflict Resolution Strategy: Workplace Peer Conflict**

**Conflict Analysis**
Root issues identified:

- Communication breakdown: Disagreement escalated without direct conversation
- Unclear authority: Ambiguous decision-making boundaries on shared project
- Trust breach: Going to boss first feels like an end-run around collaboration

Your underlying need: Respect and direct communication as equals
Her likely need: Validation of her approach, feeling heard, possibly security about her position

**Pre-Conversation Preparation**

_Mindset Shift_

- Goal is mutual understanding, not winning or proving you were right
- Her going to the boss likely came from frustration, not malice toward you
- Focus on future collaboration, not relitigating past grievances
- You both want the project to succeed

_Your Opening Statement (prepare and practice)_
"Sarah, I'd like to talk about how we can work together more effectively on this project. I value our working relationship and want to make sure we're collaborating well. Do you have 30 minutes this week to discuss?"

**Conversation Framework**

_Step 1: Acknowledge the Situation (5 minutes)_
"I realize we've had some tension lately. I want to understand your perspective better before sharing mine."

_Step 2: Listen First (10 minutes)_
"What's been frustrating for you about our project collaboration?"

- Really listen. Do not defend or explain. Take notes if helpful.
- Reflect back: "So what I'm hearing is..."
- Ask follow-up: "What else?"

_Step 3: Share Your Experience (10 minutes)_
"Can I share my perspective? I felt caught off guard when the approach disagreement went to [boss] before we discussed it directly. I would have preferred working it out together first. I value being able to collaborate directly."

_Step 4: Find Common Ground (10 minutes)_
"It sounds like we both want this project to succeed and want a good working relationship. What would help you feel better about how we collaborate going forward?"

_Step 5: Agree on Path Forward (5 minutes)_
"How about we agree to [specific communication approach] going forward? Can we try that for the next two weeks and then check in?"

**De-escalation Phrases for Difficult Moments**

- "Help me understand your thinking on that."
- "I can see this is important to you."
- "Let me make sure I've got this right..."
- "What would a good solution look like for you?"
- "I hear you. That makes sense from your perspective."

**Potential Agreements to Propose**

- Weekly 15-minute sync on project decisions before escalating
- Commitment to discuss concerns directly before involving manager
- Clear division of decision-making authority: "You own X decisions, I own Y decisions"
- Agreement to assume good intent and ask clarifying questions first

**After the Conversation**

- Follow through consistently on whatever you agree to
- Proactively include her in relevant decisions
- Build small moments of positive interaction (coffee, quick check-ins)
- If tension resurfaces, address it within 24 hours using the same framework

**Signs of Successful Resolution**

- Direct conversations replacing tension-filled email/Slack exchanges
- Proactive information sharing both directions
- Ability to disagree on specifics without relationship damage
- Other team members notice improved dynamic
