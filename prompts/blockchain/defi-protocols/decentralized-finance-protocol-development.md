## Description

This prompt helps you build secure DeFi protocols including automated market makers (AMMs), yield farming systems, and lending platforms with proper tokenomics and risk management.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you build a secure and profitable DeFi protocol. Let me understand your project:

**Protocol concept:**
1. What type of DeFi protocol? (AMM/DEX, lending, yield farming, derivatives)
2. What problem are you solving for users?
3. What's your target market? (retail users, institutions, other protocols)
4. What makes your protocol unique?

**Technical setup:**
5. Which blockchain(s)? (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, etc.)
6. What's your development experience level?
7. Do you have smart contract developers?
8. What's your budget for development and audits?

**Tokenomics and incentives:**
9. Will you have a governance token?
10. How will you incentivize liquidity providers?
11. What are your revenue streams?
12. How will you bootstrap initial liquidity?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**PROTOCOL ARCHITECTURE** - Smart contract design and implementation plan
**TOKENOMICS MODEL** - Token distribution and incentive mechanisms
**SECURITY FRAMEWORK** - Audit checklist and risk mitigation
**LAUNCH STRATEGY** - Go-to-market plan and liquidity bootstrapping
**RISK MANAGEMENT** - Economic attacks prevention and monitoring

Share your DeFi vision and let's build something secure and profitable!
```

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. AMM/DEX - Building a concentrated liquidity AMM like Uniswap V3
2. Solving capital efficiency - most AMMs waste 99% of liquidity outside price range
3. Targeting professional traders and large liquidity providers
4. Dynamic fee tiers that adjust based on volatility + MEV protection

5. Ethereum mainnet first, then Arbitrum and Polygon
6. Intermediate - built simple contracts before but not full DeFi
7. Have 2 Solidity developers, need to hire 1 more senior dev
8. $500K budget - $300K development, $200K for multiple audits

9. Yes - governance token for fee distribution and protocol decisions
10. Trading fees + bonus emissions for concentrated positions
11. Trading fees (0.05-1% based on volatility) + potential MEV revenue
12. $2M initial liquidity from team/investors + liquidity mining program
```

**Assistant Output:**

Here's your comprehensive DeFi protocol development plan:

## PROTOCOL ARCHITECTURE

### Smart Contract Design

```
Core Contracts Needed:

1. Pool Factory Contract
   - Creates new trading pairs
   - Manages protocol fees
   - Handles upgrades

2. Pool Contract (per trading pair)  
   - Concentrated liquidity positions
   - Dynamic fee calculation
   - MEV protection mechanisms
   - Price oracle integration

3. Position Manager Contract
   - NFT-based liquidity positions
   - Fee collection and compounding
   - Position visualization

4. Router Contract
   - Multi-hop swaps
   - Slippage protection
   - Gas optimization
```

### Technical Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Core AMM (Months 1-3)**
```
Week 1-4: Pool Factory + Basic Pool
- Deploy factory contract
- Implement basic swap functionality
- Add liquidity provision

Week 5-8: Concentrated Liquidity
- Range-based positions
- Tick-based math implementation
- Position NFTs

Week 9-12: Advanced Features
- Dynamic fees based on volatility
- MEV protection (commit-reveal)
- Oracle price feeds
```

**Security Considerations:**
- Use OpenZeppelin libraries for standard functions
- Implement reentrancy guards on all external calls
- Add emergency pause functionality
- Comprehensive input validation

## TOKENOMICS MODEL

### Token Distribution (100M total supply)

```
Team & Advisors: 20M (20%) - 4 year vesting
Investors: 15M (15%) - 2 year vesting  
Treasury: 25M (25%) - Protocol development
Liquidity Mining: 30M (30%) - 3 year distribution
Public Sale: 10M (10%) - No vesting
```

### Incentive Mechanisms

**Liquidity Provider Rewards:**
```
Base Trading Fees: 60% to LPs
Bonus Emissions: 
- 2x multiplier for full-range positions
- 4x multiplier for tight ranges (Â±2%)
- 6x multiplier for active management

Weekly Distribution: 200K tokens
Reduction: 5% every 3 months
```

**Fee Structure:**
```
Stable Pairs (USDC/USDT): 0.05%
Standard Pairs (ETH/USDC): 0.3%  
Exotic Pairs: 1.0%
Dynamic Adjustment: Â±50% based on volatility
```

### Revenue Model

**Protocol Revenue Streams:**
1. **Trading Fees**: 40% of all trading fees to protocol
2. **MEV Revenue**: 50% of captured MEV value
3. **Flash Loan Fees**: 0.09% on all flash loans
4. **Governance Token Sales**: Strategic token releases

**Projected Revenue (Year 1):**
- Daily Volume Target: $50M â†’ $18B annually
- Average Fee: 0.25% â†’ $45M fee revenue
- Protocol Share: 40% â†’ $18M protocol revenue

## SECURITY FRAMEWORK

### Smart Contract Security Checklist

**Pre-Audit Development:**
```
âœ“ Use proven libraries (OpenZeppelin, PRBMath)
âœ“ Implement comprehensive tests (>95% coverage)
âœ“ Add overflow/underflow protection
âœ“ Validate all external inputs
âœ“ Implement proper access controls
âœ“ Add emergency pause mechanisms
âœ“ Document all functions thoroughly
```

**Testing Strategy:**
```
Unit Tests: Individual function testing
Integration Tests: Contract interaction testing  
Fuzzing: Random input testing
Simulation: Large-scale transaction simulation
Formal Verification: Mathematical proof of correctness
```
