This prompt helps you build secure digital identity management systems using blockchain technology for self-sovereign identity, credential verification, and privacy-preserving authentication.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you build a secure digital identity management system using blockchain. Let me understand your requirements:

**Identity use case:**
1. What type of identities will you manage? (employee, customer, citizen, student)
2. What credentials need verification? (education, employment, licenses, certifications)
3. Who are the verifiers? (employers, institutions, government, banks)
4. What privacy level is required? (selective disclosure, zero-knowledge, anonymous)

**Technical requirements:**
5. Which blockchain platform? (Ethereum, Hyperledger Indy, Polygon, Cosmos)
6. Do you need mobile wallet integration?
7. What's your compliance scope? (GDPR, CCPA, industry-specific)
8. Integration needs? (existing HR systems, CRM, government databases)

**Business context:**
9. What's your organization type? (enterprise, government, startup, nonprofit)
10. How many identities will you manage? (thousands, millions, global scale)
11. What's your budget for development and compliance?
12. Timeline for deployment?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**IDENTITY ARCHITECTURE** - Blockchain network and credential schema design
**PRIVACY FRAMEWORK** - Zero-knowledge proofs and selective disclosure
**WALLET INTEGRATION** - Mobile and web wallet implementation
**COMPLIANCE SYSTEM** - GDPR/regulatory compliance automation

Share your identity management needs and let's build a privacy-first solution!
```

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Employee and contractor identities for global consulting firm
2. Education credentials, certifications, security clearances, employment history
3. Verifiers: clients, government agencies, certification bodies, background check companies
4. High privacy - need selective disclosure for different verification contexts

5. Ethereum mainnet with Polygon for lower costs
6. Yes - must work with mobile wallets (MetaMask, Trust Wallet)
7. GDPR compliance mandatory, SOC 2 compliance preferred
8. Integration with Workday HR, Salesforce, Active Directory

9. Enterprise - global consulting with 50,000 employees
10. 50K employees + 20K contractors, expanding to 100K over 2 years
11. $2M budget - $1.2M development, $500K compliance, $300K ongoing
12. 12-month deployment with 3-month pilot
```

**Assistant Output:**

Here's your comprehensive digital identity management system:

## IDENTITY ARCHITECTURE

### Blockchain Infrastructure Design

```
Core Components:

1. Identity Registry Contract (Ethereum)
   - Decentralized identifiers (DIDs)
   - Public key management
   - Credential schema registry
   - Revocation lists

2. Credential Issuer Service (Polygon)
   - Verifiable credential creation
   - Digital signature management
   - Batch issuance optimization
   - Cost-efficient transactions

3. Verification API Gateway
   - Real-time credential verification
   - Selective disclosure protocols
   - Integration middleware
   - Audit logging
```

### DID Architecture

**Employee DID Structure:**
```
DID Format: did:ethr:0x...employee_address
DID Document Contains:
- Public keys for verification
- Service endpoints for credential retrieval
- Authentication methods
- Capability invocation rights

Schema Registry:
- Education credentials (degrees, certifications)
- Employment history (roles, dates, performance)
- Security clearances (levels, expiration dates)
- Professional licenses (status, renewal dates)
```

### Credential Schema Design

**Education Credential Example:**
```json
{
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EducationCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:ethr:0x...university_address",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:ethr:0x...employee_address",
    "degree": "Master of Computer Science",
    "institution": "Stanford University",
    "graduationDate": "2020-06-15",
    "gpa": "3.8" // Optional selective disclosure
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2019",
    "verificationMethod": "did:ethr:0x...university_key",
    "proofValue": "0x..."
  }
}
```

## PRIVACY FRAMEWORK

### Zero-Knowledge Proof Implementation

**Selective Disclosure Features:**
```
Privacy Levels:

Level 1: Basic Verification
- Credential exists and is valid
- Issuer verification only
- No personal data disclosed

Level 2: Attribute Verification  
- Specific claims (e.g., "has security clearance")
- Boolean responses only
- Age/date range proofs

Level 3: Partial Disclosure
- Select specific fields to share
- Granular control per verifier
- Encrypted non-disclosed fields

Level 4: Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- Prove qualifications without revealing details
- Range proofs (e.g., GPA > 3.5)
- Set membership proofs
```

### Privacy Controls Implementation

**User Consent Management:**
```
Consent Framework:
1. Purpose specification (why data is needed)
2. Data minimization (only required fields)
3. Retention periods (auto-deletion)
4. Withdrawal mechanisms (revoke access)

Technical Implementation:
- Smart contract consent records
- Encrypted credential storage
- User-controlled decryption keys
- Audit trail preservation
```

### GDPR Compliance Automation

**Right to be Forgotten:**
```
Implementation Strategy:
- Off-chain encrypted credential storage
- On-chain commitment hashes only
- User-controlled encryption keys
- Automated data deletion workflows

Compliance Monitoring:
- Real-time consent tracking
- Automated compliance reporting
- Privacy impact assessments
- Data breach notification system
```

## WALLET INTEGRATION

### Mobile Wallet Architecture

**Supported Wallets:**
```
Primary: MetaMask Mobile
- DID management integration

### Credential Presentation Flow

**QR Code Verification Process:**
```
Step 1: Verifier Request Generation

- Specifies required credentials
- Generates QR code with request

Step 2: User Scanning & Consent
- Employee scans QR with wallet
- Reviews requested information
- Selects disclosure level
- Provides consent confirmation

Step 3: Credential Presentation

- Applies privacy filters
- Signs with user's private key
- Transmits to verifier

Step 4: Verification & Response
- Verifier validates signatures
- Checks revocation status
- Records verification audit
- Provides access/approval
```

## SYSTEM INTEGRATION

{
  "presentation": "...", 
  "challenge": "...",
  "domain": "client.com"
}

// Bulk employee verification
POST /api/verify/batch
{
  "employees": ["did:ethr:0x...", "did:ethr:0x..."],
