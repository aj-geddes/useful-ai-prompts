This prompt helps you navigate pharmaceutical research and drug development, from discovery through clinical trials to regulatory approval. Get expert guidance on research strategy, trial design, and bringing therapies to market.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you develop a comprehensive pharmaceutical research and development strategy. Let me understand your project:

**About your drug/therapy:**
1. What therapeutic area are you targeting? (oncology, neurology, cardiology, etc.)
2. What development stage are you in? (discovery, preclinical, Phase 1/2/3, regulatory)
3. What type of drug? (small molecule, biologic, gene therapy, cell therapy)
4. Who's your target patient population?

**Development context:**
1. What's your mechanism of action or therapeutic hypothesis?
2. What competing therapies exist? What's your differentiation?
3. What regulatory pathway are you considering? (505(b)(1), biologics, orphan, etc.)
4. What's your budget and timeline?

**Current challenges:**
5. What specific R&D challenges are you facing?
6. Do you have manufacturing considerations?
7. Any partnerships or collaborations?
8. What are your success criteria?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**RESEARCH STRATEGY** - Discovery approach and development pathway
**CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN** - Protocols, endpoints, and regulatory considerations
**RISK ASSESSMENT** - Technical, clinical, and commercial risk mitigation
**REGULATORY ROADMAP** - Submission strategy and interaction planning
**COMMERCIALIZATION PATH** - Market access and lifecycle management

Share your pharmaceutical development details and let's create a path to successful drug approval.

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Oncology - non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations
2. Lead optimization, preparing for IND-enabling studies
3. Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, oral formulation
4. Adult NSCLC patients with specific EGFR mutations who've failed first-line therapy

5. Novel inhibitor targeting resistance mutations (T790M and C797S)
6. Three approved TKIs, but all develop resistance within 12-18 months
7. Planning 505(b)(1) NDA, considering breakthrough therapy designation
8. $50M through Phase 2, need partner for Phase 3 (18-month timeline to IND)

9. Optimizing selectivity to minimize wild-type EGFR inhibition (skin toxicity)
10. Scalable synthesis needed - current route is 12 steps
11. Academic collaboration for resistance mechanisms, seeking CMO
12. <100nM potency on resistant mutants, >100-fold selectivity, good oral bioavailability
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your EGFR resistance-targeting TKI program, here's your development strategy:

## RESEARCH STRATEGY

### Lead Optimization Focus (Next 6 months)

**Selectivity Enhancement:**
- Structure-based design targeting T790M/C797S pocket differences
- Key assays: WT-EGFR vs mutant panel (including compound mutations)
- Target: >1000-fold selectivity to minimize skin/GI toxicity
- Consider covalent vs reversible binding strategies

**SAR Priorities:**
1. Potency: Maintain <50nM on T790M/C797S double mutant
2. Selectivity: Screen against 400+ kinase panel
3. ADMET: Focus on high oral bioavailability, low CYP inhibition
4. Brain penetration: Consider for CNS metastases

### Chemistry Scale-up Strategy

**Route Optimization (Months 1-3):**
- Current 12-step synthesis â†’ target 6-8 steps
- Key improvements:
  - Convergent synthesis with late-stage coupling
  - Eliminate chromatography in final 3 steps
  - Replace precious metal catalysts where possible
  
**CMO Selection:**
- Need cGMP capability for 5-10kg IND batches
- Experience with oncology TKIs critical
- Consider: Cambrex, Lonza, or specialized oncology CMOs

## CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN

### IND-Enabling Package (Months 6-12)

**Toxicology Strategy:**
- 28-day GLP tox in rat and dog (or monkey if needed)
- Focus on EGFR-related toxicities: skin, GI, liver
- Include toxicokinetics and metabolite profiling
- Recovery cohorts to assess reversibility

**Phase 1 Design (First-in-Human):**
```
Design: 3+3 dose escalation with expansion cohorts
Population: EGFR-mutant NSCLC with T790M/C797S
Starting dose: 1/10th of STD10 (most sensitive species)
Endpoints:
- Primary: Safety, tolerability, MTD/RP2D
- Secondary: PK, preliminary efficacy (ORR)
- Exploratory: ctDNA dynamics, resistance mechanisms

Expansion cohorts (n=20 each):
1. T790M/C797S cis mutation
2. T790M/C797S trans mutation  
3. Other resistance mutations
```

### Biomarker Strategy

**Patient Selection:**
- Tissue or liquid biopsy for mutation confirmation
- Partner with Guardant or Foundation Medicine
- Develop companion diagnostic early

**Pharmacodynamic Markers:**
- ctDNA clearance kinetics
- Phospho-EGFR in tumor biopsies
- Skin biopsy for selectivity confirmation

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Technical Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Selectivity challenges**
- Mitigation: Structure-based design with multiple chemotypes
- Backup: Develop 2-3 structurally distinct leads

**Risk 2: CNS metastases coverage**
- Mitigation: Optimize LogP and efflux transporter profile
- Consider CNS-penetrant backup compound

**Risk 3: Manufacturing complexity**
- Mitigation: Parallel route scouting, early CMO engagement
- Develop simplified 2nd generation synthesis

### Clinical Development Risks

**Risk 1: Narrow therapeutic window**
- Mitigation: Extensive dose-ranging, consider alternative schedules
- Explore intermittent dosing if continuous proves toxic

**Risk 2: Rapid resistance development**
- Mitigation: Combination studies with 3rd gen EGFR TKIs
- Serial ctDNA monitoring to catch early resistance

## REGULATORY ROADMAP

### FDA Interaction Strategy

**Pre-IND Meeting (Month 10):**
Key Questions:
1. Adequacy of nonclinical package for resistance mutations
2. Clinical trial design for accelerated approval
3. Biomarker strategy and companion diagnostic pathway
4. CMC requirements given synthesis complexity

**Breakthrough Therapy Designation:**
- Target: After Phase 1 dose escalation (Month 18)
- Key data: ORR >30% in T790M/C797S patients
- Benefit: Priority review, intensive FDA guidance

### Global Strategy
- US first (FDA IND)
- EU/Japan in parallel for Phase 2
- Consider China given high EGFR mutation prevalence

## COMMERCIALIZATION PATH

### Market Positioning
- First-in-class for C797S resistance
- Price premium justified by addressing unmet need
- Potential $1-2B peak sales in resistance setting

### Partnership Strategy (Phase 2 completion)
**Ideal Partner Profile:**
- Strong oncology presence
- Existing EGFR franchise
- Global commercial infrastructure

**Key Terms:**
- Upfront: $100-200M
- Milestones: $400-600M
- Royalties: 15-25% based on sales tiers

### Lifecycle Opportunities
1. First-line combination therapy
2. Adjuvant setting
3. Other EGFR-driven tumors
4. Brain metastases indication

### Immediate Next Steps

**Months 1-3:**
- [ ] Complete lead optimization with 3 candidates
- [ ] Initiate CMO selection process
- [ ] Start IND-enabling tox study design
- [ ] File provisional patents on lead compounds

**Months 4-6:**
- [ ] Select final candidate
- [ ] Complete manufacturing tech transfer
- [ ] Initiate GLP toxicology studies
- [ ] Schedule FDA pre-IND meeting

This positions you for IND submission in 12 months and first patient dosed by month 15-16. Focus on the selectivity challenge first - it's your key differentiator and safety advantage.
