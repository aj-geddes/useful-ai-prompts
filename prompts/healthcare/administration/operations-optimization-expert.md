## Description

This prompt helps you transform healthcare operations into efficient, patient-centered systems that improve clinical outcomes while reducing costs and enhancing staff satisfaction.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you optimize your healthcare operations for better patient outcomes and operational efficiency. Let me understand your healthcare setting:

**About your facility:**
1. What type of healthcare facility? (hospital, clinic, outpatient, specialty center)
2. What size and scale? (beds, daily patients, annual volume)
3. What service lines do you offer?
4. What's your patient mix? (demographics, payer types)

**Current operations:**
5. What are your main operational challenges?
6. What metrics concern you most? (wait times, throughput, costs, quality)
7. What's your current technology stack? (EHR, scheduling, etc.)
8. How would you describe staff morale and retention?

**Goals and constraints:**
9. What operational improvements are most critical?
10. What's your budget for improvements?
11. Any regulatory requirements or upcoming inspections?
12. What's your timeline for seeing results?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS** - Operational assessment with key bottlenecks
**WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION** - Streamlined processes for efficiency
**PATIENT EXPERIENCE PLAN** - Strategies to improve satisfaction and outcomes
**TECHNOLOGY RECOMMENDATIONS** - Systems to enhance operations
**IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP** - Phased approach with quick wins and long-term gains

Share your healthcare operations details and let's create a more efficient, patient-centered system.

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. 200-bed community hospital with emergency department
2. 150 average daily census, 30K annual admissions, 120K ED visits
3. Med/surg, ICU, ED, surgery, imaging, lab, outpatient clinics
4. Mixed - 40% Medicare, 25% Medicaid, 30% commercial, 5% self-pay

5. Long ED wait times (4+ hours), high left-without-being-seen rate, OR delays
6. Patient satisfaction below 50th percentile, readmission rates above target
7. Epic EHR (5 years old), basic scheduling system, no patient flow tools
8. Nursing turnover 22%, physician burnout high, staff feel overwhelmed

9. Reduce ED wait times, improve patient flow, reduce readmissions
10. $500K available for technology/process improvements this year
11. Joint Commission survey in 6 months, CMS star ratings dropping
12. Need measurable improvements within 90 days for board presentation
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your 200-bed community hospital challenges, here's a comprehensive optimization strategy:

## CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### Key Performance Gaps
- **ED Throughput Crisis**: 4+ hour waits causing 8-10% LWBS rate (industry standard: <2%)
- **Patient Flow Bottlenecks**: Bed turnover delays creating ED boarding
- **Clinical Efficiency**: OR first-case delays averaging 35 minutes
- **Quality Metrics**: Readmission rates 2-3% above CMS targets
- **Staff Burnout**: 22% nursing turnover vs. 17% national average

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **No real-time visibility** into bed availability and patient status
2. **Fragmented communication** between departments
3. **Manual processes** for bed assignments and transport
4. **Lack of predictive analytics** for demand planning

## WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION

### Emergency Department Transformation

**Immediate Actions (Week 1-2):**
- Implement "split-flow" triage model:
  - Fast track for ESI 4-5 patients (30% of volume)
  - Vertical treatment zones for ambulatory patients
  - Provider-in-triage for immediate evaluation
  
**Technology Quick Win ($50K):**
- Deploy ED tracking board with real-time status
- Automated text updates to patients/families
- Direct bedding protocols for specific conditions

**Expected Impact**: 25-30% reduction in door-to-provider time

### Inpatient Flow Optimization

**Bed Management Command Center (Month 1-2):**
```
Morning Huddle Structure (7:30 AM daily):
- Predicted discharges by unit
- ED admission queue
- OR schedule and bed needs
- Bottleneck identification
- Action assignments
```

**Discharge Planning Enhancement:**
- Discharge by 11 AM initiative
- Pharmacy med-rec at admission
- Transportation booking 24 hours advance
- Criteria-based discharge protocols

### OR Efficiency Program

**First-Case On-Time Starts:**
- Pre-op phone calls day before
- Equipment standardization by procedure
- Parallel processing for room turnover
- Surgeon preference cards audit

**Target**: 90% first-case on-time starts within 60 days

## PATIENT EXPERIENCE PLAN

### ED Experience Improvements

**Communication Protocol:**
- Comfort rounds every 30 minutes
- Provider updates every 60 minutes
- Estimated wait time displays
- Volunteer navigator program

**Comfort Measures:**
- Refresh station with water/snacks
- Phone charging stations
- Improved waiting room seating
- Children's activity area

### Inpatient Satisfaction Strategy

**Bedside Shift Report**
- Involve patients in handoff
- Address top 3 concerns
- Confirm understanding

**Purposeful Hourly Rounding**
- Pain, Position, Potty, Possessions
- Document completion rates
- Link to call light reduction

### Care Coordination

**Transition Care Team:**
