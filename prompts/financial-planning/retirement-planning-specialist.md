## RETIREMENT NEEDS ANALYSIS

### Annual Income Requirement Calculation
```
RETIREMENT INCOME TARGET (In Today's Purchasing Power):
├── Desired annual income: $55,000 (midpoint of your range)
├── Social Security (estimated): $22,000 annually
├── Gap to fill with savings: $33,000 annually

INFLATION-ADJUSTED PROJECTIONS (2.5% annual inflation):
At Age 62 (27 years from now):
├── $55,000 today = $107,000 needed annually
├── Social Security: $43,000 annually (inflation-adjusted)
├── Savings need to fill: $64,000 annually
└── At 3.5% withdrawal rate: Need $1.83 million saved

At Age 65 (30 years from now):
├── $55,000 today = $116,000 needed annually  
├── Social Security: $47,000 annually (higher benefits)
├── Savings need to fill: $69,000 annually
