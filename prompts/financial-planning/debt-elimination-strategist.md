## OPTIMAL DEBT PAYOFF STRATEGY

### Hybrid Avalanche-Snowball Approach
```
DEBT PRIORITIZATION STRATEGY:
Phase 1: Quick Win + High Interest (Months 1-8)
├── Target: Credit Card 2 ($3,200 @ 18%) - FIRST
├── Reason: Smallest balance for quick psychological win
├── Payment: $1,000/month (minimum + $850 extra)
├── Timeline: 3.5 months to payoff
└── Psychological boost: First debt eliminated quickly

Phase 2: Highest Interest Focus (Months 4-18)
├── Target: Credit Card 1 ($8,500 @ 22%) - SECOND
├── Payment: $1,150/month (minimum + freed up $850)
├── Timeline: 8 months after CC2 is paid
└── Maximum interest savings: $4,800+ saved vs. minimums

Phase 3: Moderate Interest (Months 19-30)
├── Target: Car Loan ($12,000 @ 5.5%) - THIRD
├── Payment: $1,350/month (all freed up money)
├── Timeline: 9-10 months
└── Reason: Higher payment than student loans, good momentum

Phase 4: Final Push (Months 31-42)
├── Target: Student Loans ($22,000 @ 4.5%) - LAST
├── Payment: $1,550/month (all available funds)
├── Timeline: 15 months
└── Lowest interest rate, often tax deductible
```

### Monthly Payment Allocation Plan
```
CURRENT MINIMUMS TOTAL: $695/month
├── Credit Card 1: $200 minimum
├── Credit Card 2: $75 minimum
├── Car loan: $220 minimum
├── Student loans: $200 minimum

PHASE 1 ALLOCATION (Months 1-4):
Total debt payments: $1,195/month
├── Credit Card 2: $925 ($75 + $850 extra) → PAYOFF FOCUS
├── Credit Card 1: $200 (minimum only)
├── Car loan: $220 (minimum only)
├── Student loans: $200 (minimum only)
└── Result: CC2 paid off in 3.5 months

PHASE 2 ALLOCATION (Months 4-12):
├── Credit Card 1: $1,125 (minimum + CC2 payment freed up)
├── Car loan: $220 (minimum only)
├── Student loans: $200 (minimum only)
└── Result: CC1 paid off in 8 additional months

TOTAL DEBT-FREE TIMELINE: 42 months (3.5 years)
```

## DEBT CONSOLIDATION EVALUATION

### Balance Transfer Analysis
```
CREDIT CARD CONSOLIDATION OPPORTUNITY:
Current CC debt: $11,700 @ weighted average 21% interest
Balance transfer option: 0% APR for 18-21 months

CONSOLIDATION BENEFITS:
├── Interest savings: $3,500+ during promotional period
├── Single payment simplification
├── Breathing room to build emergency fund simultaneously
├── Faster payoff timeline: 12-15 months vs. 12-18 months

CONSOLIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
├── Good credit needed (you're borderline at 620-640)
├── Transfer fee: Usually 3-5% of balance ($350-585)
├── Must stop using old cards completely
├── Must pay off balance before promotional rate expires
└── Discipline required to not accumulate new debt

RECOMMENDATION: Apply for balance transfer
└── Even if only partial approval, any 0% interest helps
```

### Personal Loan Consideration
```
PERSONAL LOAN FOR CREDIT CARDS:
Loan amount needed: $11,700
Estimated rate at your credit: 12-16%
Term: 3-4 years

PROS:

├── Improves credit mix

CONS:

Phase 2 (Month 12): CC1 paid off  
├── Utilization drops to 0% on credit cards
