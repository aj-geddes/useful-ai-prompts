## GOAL-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

### Retirement Strategy (Primary Goal)
```
ACCUMULATION PHASE (Ages 32-55):
- Maximize tax-advantaged contributions
- Focus on growth-oriented investments
- Reinvest all dividends
- Annual rebalancing

PRESERVATION PHASE (Ages 55-65):
- Gradually shift to more conservative allocation
- Begin considering withdrawal strategies
- Reduce portfolio volatility
- Maintain some growth exposure for inflation protection

WITHDRAWAL PHASE (Age 65+):
- 4% rule as baseline (adjust based on portfolio performance)
- Strategic withdrawal order (taxable → traditional IRA → Roth IRA)
- Maintain 50/50 stocks/bonds allocation
- Consider annuities for guaranteed income base
```

### House Down Payment Strategy
```
TARGET: $50,000 in 5-7 years
MONTHLY SAVINGS: $300 in taxable account + $300 extra into separate "house fund"

YEAR-BY-YEAR APPROACH:
Year 1-2: Aggressive saving and investing ($600/month = $14,400)
Year 3-4: Continue contributions, monitor market conditions
Year 5-6: Begin shifting to more conservative investments
Year 7: Mostly cash/short-term bonds, ready for purchase

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- If market performs well, could achieve goal in 5 years
- If market struggles, extend timeline to 7 years
- Consider additional savings if opportunity arises
```

## QUARTERLY REVIEW PROCESS

### Performance Monitoring
```
QUARTERLY CHECKLIST:
□ Review portfolio performance vs. benchmarks
□ Check asset allocation drift (>5% from target = rebalance)
□ Assess progress toward goals (retirement and house)
□ Review contributions and increase if income grows
□ Evaluate any life changes affecting strategy

KEY METRICS TO TRACK:
- Net worth growth rate
- Portfolio return vs. age-appropriate benchmark
- Savings rate percentage
- Progress toward $50k house fund
- Years to retirement at current savings rate
```

### Annual Strategy Adjustments
```
DECEMBER REVIEW PROCESS:
1. Calculate total returns for the year
2. Rebalance portfolios to target allocations
3. Tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts
4. Increase contributions with salary increases
5. Adjust asset allocation for age (if applicable)
6. Review and update financial goals
```

## TAX OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### Asset Location Strategy
```
TAX-ADVANTAGED ACCOUNTS (401k, IRA):
- REITs (high dividend yields)
- International stocks (for foreign tax credits)
- Actively managed funds (higher turnover)
- Bonds and bond funds (interest taxed as ordinary income)

TAXABLE ACCOUNTS:
- Broad market index funds (tax-efficient)
- Individual stocks for long-term capital gains
- Municipal bonds (if in high tax bracket)
- ESG funds with low turnover
```

### Tax-Loss Harvesting
```
SYSTEMATIC APPROACH:
- Review taxable accounts quarterly
- Harvest losses >$1,000 when available
- Avoid wash sale rules (30-day wait)
- Reinvest in similar but not identical funds
- Carry forward losses to offset future gains
```

## RISK MANAGEMENT

### Portfolio Protection Strategies
```
DIVERSIFICATION:
- Geographic: US (65%) + International (35%)
- Asset Class: Stocks, bonds, REITs, cash
- Sector: Broad market index funds prevent over-concentration
- Time: Dollar-cost averaging reduces timing risk

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS:
- Maintain 6-month emergency fund separate from investments
- Avoid touching retirement accounts before 59.5
- House fund can serve as backup emergency fund if needed
- Have withdrawal strategy for different market conditions
```

### Market Volatility Management
```
BEAR MARKET PROTOCOL:
1. Don't panic - stick to the plan
2. Continue regular contributions (dollar-cost averaging)
3. Rebalance to take advantage of lower prices
4. Consider tax-loss harvesting opportunities
5. Review withdrawal timeline for house purchase

BULL MARKET PROTOCOL:
1. Stay disciplined - don't chase performance
2. Rebalance when allocations drift >5%
3. Consider taking some gains in house fund
4. Don't increase risk beyond comfort level
5. Continue systematic investing approach
```
