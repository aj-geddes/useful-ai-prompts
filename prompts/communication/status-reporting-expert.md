## Description

This prompt helps you create clear, informative status reports that keep stakeholders aligned, surface issues early, and drive action - all while minimizing reporting overhead.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you create status reports that actually get read and drive action. Let me understand your reporting needs:

**About your project:**
1. What project/initiative are you reporting on?
2. What's the current phase and timeline?
3. What are the key deliverables or milestones?
4. What's the overall complexity level?

**About your audience:**
5. Who reads these reports? (executives, team, clients)
6. What do they care about most? (budget, timeline, quality, risks)
7. How much detail do they want?
8. How often do they need updates?

**Current challenges:**
9. What problems do you have with current reporting?
10. What questions come up repeatedly?
11. How much time are you spending on reports?
12. What format do stakeholders prefer?

Based on your answers, I'll create:

**STATUS REPORT TEMPLATE** - Customized format with the right level of detail
**VISUAL DASHBOARD** - Key metrics and progress indicators at a glance
**REPORTING EFFICIENCY PLAN** - How to gather data and create reports faster
**COMMUNICATION STRATEGY** - When and how to deliver different types of updates
**ESCALATION FRAMEWORK** - How to surface issues appropriately

Share your reporting context and I'll design a system that informs without overwhelming.
```

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Software development project - new mobile app for customers
2. Month 3 of 9, in development phase after completing design
3. Key milestones: MVP in month 5, beta in month 7, launch month 9
4. Medium complexity - 5 developers, 3 platforms, external API integrations

5. Reports go to: Product VP (weekly), CEO (monthly), Board (quarterly)
6. VP cares about features/timeline, CEO about budget/ROI, Board about strategic impact
7. VP wants moderate detail, CEO wants summary + exceptions, Board wants highlights only
8. Weekly for VP, monthly for CEO, quarterly for Board

9. Takes too long to compile, different people want different formats, lots of redundancy
10. "Are we on track?", "What's blocking progress?", "When will X feature be ready?"
11. About 4-5 hours per week on various status updates
12. VP likes dashboards, CEO prefers email, Board wants slides
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your mobile app development project needs, here's a comprehensive status reporting system:

## STATUS REPORT TEMPLATES

## VISUAL DASHBOARD COMPONENTS

### Real-Time Project Dashboard
```javascript
// Key Metrics to Track
const dashboardMetrics = {
  // Progress Indicators
  overallProgress: {
    planned: calculatePlannedProgress(),
    actual: calculateActualProgress(),
    variance: calculateVariance()
  },
  
  // Health Indicators
  schedule: { status: 'yellow', daysAhead: -5 },
  budget: { status: 'green', variance: +4 },
  quality: { status: 'green', defectRate: 0.02 },
  team: { status: 'green', utilization: 0.85 },
  
  // Milestone Tracking
  milestones: [
    { name: 'Design Complete', status: 'done', date: '2024-01-15' },
    { name: 'MVP Ready', status: 'in-progress', date: '2024-03-15' },
    { name: 'Beta Launch', status: 'planned', date: '2024-05-01' }
  ]
};
```

### Visual Elements Design
- **Traffic light system**: Green/Yellow/Red for instant status
