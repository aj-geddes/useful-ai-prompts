## Description

This prompt helps you build high-performing teams through effective collaboration strategies, whether they're co-located, remote, or hybrid. Get practical solutions for communication, tools, and team culture.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you create a high-performing team through better collaboration. Let me understand your team dynamics:

**About your team:**
1. How many people are on the team and what are their roles?
2. Are they co-located, hybrid, or fully remote?
3. What time zones are they in?
4. How long have they worked together?

**Current collaboration:**
5. What collaboration challenges are you facing?
6. What tools are you currently using?
7. How often does the team interact?
8. What's the team culture like now?

**Goals and constraints:**
9. What does great collaboration look like for your team?
10. What specific outcomes need to improve?
11. What's your budget for tools/training?
12. How quickly do you need to see changes?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**COLLABORATION ASSESSMENT** - Current state analysis with improvement priorities
**COMMUNICATION FRAMEWORK** - Team agreements, channels, and interaction patterns
**TOOL RECOMMENDATIONS** - Right tools for your needs with implementation guidance
**TEAM BUILDING PLAN** - Activities and rituals to strengthen relationships
**CHANGE ROADMAP** - Phased approach to transform your team collaboration

Tell me about your team and let's build a collaboration system that works.
```

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. 12 people - 5 engineers, 2 designers, 2 product managers, 2 QA, 1 project manager
2. Fully remote since pandemic, was co-located before
3. Mostly US (EST/PST), 2 engineers in Europe (CET)
4. Core team 2 years, but 4 new hires in last 6 months

5. Challenges: Europe team feels excluded, decisions made without them, duplicate work happening
6. Using Slack, Zoom, Jira, Google Docs - but inconsistently
7. Daily standups, weekly team meeting, lots of ad-hoc Slack
8. Used to be very collaborative in-office, now feels disconnected

9. Great = everyone aligned, no duplicate work, inclusive of all time zones, innovative together
10. Need faster project delivery, better quality, happier team
11. Can spend up to $500/month on new tools, have training budget
12. Need improvements within 30 days, transformation over 3 months
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your distributed team's challenges, here's your collaboration transformation plan:

## COLLABORATION ASSESSMENT

### Current State Analysis

**Collaboration Maturity: 2.5/5** - Functioning but suboptimal

**Key Issues Identified:**
1. **Time Zone Inequity** (Critical): Europe team systematically excluded from decisions
2. **Process Gaps** (High): No clear async communication protocols
3. **Tool Chaos** (Medium): Tools exist but no consistent usage patterns
4. **Culture Erosion** (High): Lost the collaborative spirit from co-located days
5. **Onboarding Gaps** (Medium): New hires not fully integrated

**Strengths to Build On:**
- Strong core team relationships (2+ years)
- Existing tool infrastructure
- Budget available for improvements
- Leadership recognition of issues

## COMMUNICATION FRAMEWORK

### Team Communication Charter

**Core Principles:**
1. **Async-First**: Default to asynchronous communication
2. **Inclusive Timing**: No decisions without 24-hour input window
3. **Documentation**: If it's not written down, it didn't happen
4. **Time Zone Equality**: Rotate meeting times monthly

### Communication Channels & Rules

**Slack Organization:**
```
#team-announcements (async, 24hr response)
- Company updates, team news
- Pin important messages
- No discussions here

#project-[name] (async collaboration)
- Project discussions
- Decisions documented
- 4-hour response expected

#team-social (optional, fun)
- Water cooler chat
- Celebrations
- No work discussions

#daily-standup (async updates)
- What I did yesterday
- What I'm doing today
- Blockers
- Europe posts AM, US reads & responds
```

**Meeting Framework:**
```
ESSENTIAL MEETINGS ONLY:
- Weekly Team Sync → Rotate times monthly
  Week 1-2: 10am EST (4pm CET)
  Week 3-4: 8am EST (2pm CET)
  
- Sprint Planning → Record for async input
- Retros → Hybrid - live + async input

ALL MEETINGS MUST HAVE:
- Agenda 24hrs in advance
- Clear decision items
- Recording for absent members
- Written summary within 2 hours
```

### Asynchronous Decision Making

**DACI Framework:**
- **Driver**: Who's leading this decision?
- **Approver**: Who has final say?
- **Contributors**: Who provides input?
- **Informed**: Who needs to know?

**Process:**
1. Driver posts decision doc in Slack
2. 24-hour comment period (covers all timezones)
3. Driver summarizes input
4. Approver makes final call
5. Decision logged in central repository
