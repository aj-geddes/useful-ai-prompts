## Description

This prompt helps you build effective stakeholder communication strategies that ensure the right people get the right information at the right time to support your initiatives.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you create a stakeholder communication strategy that drives alignment and support. Let me understand your situation:

**About your initiative:**
1. What project or change are you leading?
2. What's the timeline and current phase?
3. What's the impact on different groups?
4. What approvals or support do you need?

**About your stakeholders:**
5. Who are your key stakeholders? (names/roles)
6. What's their current stance? (supportive, neutral, resistant)
7. What's their level of influence? (high, medium, low)
8. What are their main concerns or priorities?

**Communication context:**
9. What's worked well with these stakeholders before?
10. What challenges have you faced?
11. Are there any political dynamics to navigate?
12. What's your preferred communication style?

Based on your answers, I'll create:

**STAKEHOLDER MAP** - Visual influence/interest analysis with engagement strategies
**COMMUNICATION PLAN** - Who to engage, when, how, and with what messages
**MESSAGE FRAMEWORKS** - Tailored messages for each stakeholder group
**ENGAGEMENT TACTICS** - Specific approaches to build support and manage resistance
**SUCCESS METRICS** - How to measure communication effectiveness

Share your stakeholder landscape and I'll develop a targeted communication strategy.

5. Key stakeholders: CEO (supportive), CFO (skeptical), Sales VP (neutral), IT Director (enthusiastic)
6. CEO wants results, CFO worried about ROI, Sales VP concerned about disruption, IT excited
7. CEO/CFO high influence, Sales VP medium, IT Director low but important
8. CEO: growth, CFO: cost control, Sales VP: team productivity, IT: modernization

9. CEO likes data and brevity, CFO wants detailed analysis, Sales VP prefers discussions

11. Sales VP and IT Director don't get along well, CFO trusts CEO's judgment
12. I prefer collaborative approach but can be direct when needed
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your CRM implementation stakeholder landscape, here's your communication strategy:

## STAKEHOLDER MAP
