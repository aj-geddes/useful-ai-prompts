## Q&A PREPARATION

**Q: Could this happen again?**
A: "Not with the same method. We've closed that vulnerability. However, threats evolve constantly, which is why ongoing investment is critical. This upgrade keeps us ahead of emerging threats."

**Q: Why $2M? Couldn't we do this for less?**
A: "We analyzed three options: $1M minimum compliance ($50M+ risk exposure), $2M comprehensive protection (recommended), $3M+ premium solution (diminishing returns). $2M gives us the best risk-adjusted return."

**Q: How do we know this won't affect operations?**
A: "Implementation is designed with zero downtime. We'll upgrade systems in phases during off-peak hours. Our operations team has been fully briefed and supports the plan."

**Q: What about cyber insurance coverage?**
A: "Our current policy covers basic incidents. With these upgrades, we'll qualify for enhanced coverage at 15% lower premiums, helping offset the investment cost."

**Q: How will customers react to this investment?**
A: "Customer research shows 87% prefer companies that invest proactively in security. We can position this as industry leadership, not incident response."
