**Stage 2: Open Disagreement (6 weeks ago)**

- Public disagreement in project review meetings
- Blame attribution and defensive positioning
- Information withholding and communication breakdown
- Escalation to department managers

**Stage 3: Active Conflict (Current)**

- Work-around behaviors and parallel process development
- Alliance formation and team polarization
- Executive escalation and intervention
- Project timeline and quality impact

**Root Cause Analysis**:

**Systemic Issues**:

- **Unclear Governance**: Ambiguous decision-making authority and accountability
- **Process Gaps**: Inadequate cross-functional communication and coordination processes
