Based on your conference keynote, here's your comprehensive preparation plan:

## SPEECH STRUCTURE

### Opening Hook (2 minutes)
**The Pattern Interrupt Opening:**
```
"Show of hands - how many of you have a digital transformation initiative?"
[Wait for hands]
"Keep them up if it's delivering the results you expected."
[Most hands drop]
"You're not alone. 70% of digital transformations fail because we've been thinking about them all wrong. Today, I'm going to show you why digital transformation is dead - and what's replacing it."
```

**Why this works:**
- Interactive start engages immediately
- Validates their experience
- Creates curiosity with bold claim
- Sets you up as the solution provider

### Main Content Structure (25 minutes)

**Three-Act Structure:**

**Act 1: The Problem (8 minutes)**
- Why traditional digital transformation fails
- Real examples (2-3 brief case studies)
- The cost of the old approach

**Act 2: The Paradigm Shift (9 minutes)**
- Introduce "Business Transformation" concept
- Key differences from digital-first thinking
- Framework for the new approach

**Act 3: The Path Forward (8 minutes)**
- Practical implementation steps
- Success story walkthrough
- Tools and resources

**Transitions:**
- Act 1→2: "But what if we've been asking the wrong question?"
- Act 2→3: "So how do we make this shift in our organizations?"

### Closing (3 minutes)
```
"Remember: Technology is not transformation. Transformation is about reimagining how you create value. Digital is just one of many tools in that journey.

I'll leave you with one question: What would you transform in your business if technology wasn't the constraint?

Thank you."
```

## DELIVERY TECHNIQUES

### Voice and Pacing

**Vocal Variety Map:**
- **Opening**: Conversational pace, warm tone
- **Problem section**: Gradual intensity increase
- **Statistics**: Slow down, lower pitch for impact
- **Solution**: Energetic, optimistic tone
- **Examples**: Storytelling voice, varied pace
- **Closing**: Slow, powerful, memorable

**Power Pauses:**
- After asking questions (3-4 seconds)
- Before key statistics (2 seconds)
- After main points (2-3 seconds)
- Before your closing line (3 seconds)

### Stage Presence for 300 People

**Movement Strategy:**
```
Stage Layout:
[Screen] ← 10 ft → [Center] ← 10 ft → [Screen]
         Position 1   Position 2   Position 3
```

- **Position 1**: Opening and closing
- **Position 2**: Main content delivery
- **Position 3**: Stories and examples
- Walk during transitions, plant for points

**Gesture Guidelines:**
- **Descriptive gestures**: Paint pictures with hands

- **Inclusive gestures**: Open arms to audience
- Keep above waist, make them bigger than normal

### Eye Contact Strategy
- Divide room into 6 sections

## ENGAGEMENT TACTICS

### Attention Sustainers for 30 Minutes

2. **Data slides**: One chart, clear takeaway
3. **Story slides**: Image + few words
4. **Framework slides**: Your models/processes
5. **Question slides**: For interaction

**Design Rules:**
- Maximum 6 words per slide
- High contrast (dark background works well)

- Images > bullets always
- Build complex ideas progressively

### Q&A Success Strategy

**Preparation:**
- List 10 likely questions with answers

- Have examples ready for abstract concepts

**During Q&A:**
1. Repeat/rephrase question for room
