Here's your comprehensive lesson plan for introducing linear equations:

## LESSON PLAN: Introduction to Linear Equations

### Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: 8th Grade Algebra
- **Duration**: 50 minutes
- **Topic**: Introduction to Linear Equations
- **Learning Objectives**: 
  - Identify linear equations from a set of equations
  - Understand that linear equations have variables to the first power only
  - Solve basic one-step and two-step linear equations
  - Connect linear equations to real-world situations

### Materials Needed
- Smartboard presentation
- Balance scale demonstration (physical or virtual)
- Equation sorting cards (prepared in advance)
- Chromebooks with Desmos Graphing Calculator
- Exit tickets
- Differentiated practice worksheets

## LESSON STRUCTURE

### Opening Hook (8 minutes)

**Balance Scale Mystery**
1. Display a balance scale on Smartboard with hidden weights
2. Pose problem: "If 3 boxes + 5 = 11, what's in each box?"
3. Students discuss with shoulder partner (2 min)
4. Use virtual manipulatives to demonstrate solution
5. Connect to equation solving: "We just solved 3x + 5 = 11!"

**Real-World Connection**
"Where might we use this? Think about splitting a restaurant bill, calculating phone data usage, or figuring out how many songs you can download..."

### Main Activities (30 minutes)

#### Activity 1: Equation Sort (10 minutes)
**Collaborative Exploration**

Students work in pairs with equation cards:
- Set A → Linear equations (2x + 3 = 7, y - 4 = 10, 3a = 15)
- Set B → Non-linear equations (x² = 9, 2/x = 4, √y = 3)

Task: Sort into two groups and identify the pattern

**Differentiation:**
- Advanced → Include more complex linear equations (2(x+3) = 10)
- Struggling → Provide hint cards about exponents
- ELL → Include visual representations

#### Activity 2: Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
**What Makes an Equation Linear?**

Using Smartboard:
1. Define linear equation: first-degree polynomial equation
2. Key characteristics:
   - Variables have exponent of 1 only
   - No variables in denominators
   - No variables under radicals
   - Graph forms a straight line

**Visual Examples:**
- Show equation → simplified form → identify degree
- 2x + 5 = 13 ✓ Linear
- x² + 2x = 8 ✗ Not linear (degree 2)

#### Activity 3: Guided Practice (10 minutes)
**Solving Linear Equations Together**

Model solving process using balance method:
1. Start with: 2x + 3 = 11
2. "What we do to one side, we do to the other"
3. Show each step with visual balance scale
4. Check solution by substitution

**Try Together:**
- 3x - 4 = 8 (whole class)
- x/2 + 5 = 9 (partner work)

### Differentiated Practice (7 minutes)

Students work on Chromebooks with three levels:

**Level 1 (Struggling)**: One-step equations with visual supports
- x + 5 = 12 (with balance scale image)
- 3x = 18 (with grouping visual)

**Level 2 (On-level)**: Mix of one and two-step equations
- 2x + 7 = 15
- x/3 - 2 = 4

**Level 3 (Advanced)**: Multi-step with distribution
- 2(x + 3) = 14
- 3x + 2 = 2x + 8

### Closure (5 minutes)

**Exit Ticket** (Differentiated)
All students answer:
1. Circle the linear equations: x² = 16, 2x - 3 = 7, 1/x = 4
2. Solve: [varies by level]
   - Basic: x + 6 = 10
   - On-level: 2x - 3 = 9
   - Advanced: 3(x - 2) = 12

**Quick Share**: "What's one real-world situation where you might use a linear equation?"

## ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES

### Formative Assessment
- **Equation Sort**: Monitor understanding of linear vs. non-linear
- **Partner Discussions**: Listen for mathematical reasoning
- **Thumbs Up/Down**: Quick checks during instruction
- **Chromebook Work**: Real-time monitoring via shared screens

### Summative Assessment
- **Exit Ticket**: Identifies who needs reteaching
- **Homework**: Differentiated problem sets
- **Next Class**: Quick quiz on identifying and solving linear equations

## DIFFERENTIATION PLAN

### For Advanced Students
- Challenge problems involving word problems
- Extension → Explore systems of linear equations
- Peer tutoring opportunity

### For Struggling Students
- Equation solving template/graphic organizer
- Allow use of calculator
- Reduced problem set (quality over quantity)
- Small group reteaching next day

### For IEP Students
- Extended time on exit ticket
- Modified homework (fewer problems)
- Provide step-by-step solving guide
- Check in individually during practice

### For ELL Students
- Vocabulary cards: equation, variable, solve, linear
- Sentence frames: "To solve ___, I need to ___"
- Partner with strong English speaker
- Visual vocabulary on board throughout

## HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT

**Differentiated Practice Sets**

**Set A (Struggling)**: 8 problems
- 5 one-step equations
- 3 identifying linear equations
- Online video tutorial link

**Set B (On-level)**: 12 problems  
- 4 one-step, 6 two-step equations
- 2 word problems
- Create your own linear equation

**Set C (Advanced)**: 10 problems
- 6 multi-step equations
- 3 challenging word problems
- 1 exploration: "Why do we call them linear?"

## TEACHING TIPS

1. **Timing**: Use timer on Smartboard to keep pace
2. **Engagement**: Call on random students using name cards
3. **Movement**: Have students show answers with hand signals
4. **Technology**: Pre-load Desmos activities for smooth transitions
5. **Grouping**: Pre-assign partners for productive collaboration

This lesson balances exploration with direct instruction while providing multiple opportunities for assessment and differentiation. The real-world connections and collaborative elements will keep students engaged while building strong foundational understanding.
