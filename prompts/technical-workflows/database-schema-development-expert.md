Design efficient, normalized database schemas that support your application's data requirements while ensuring performance, integrity, and scalability.

## Prompt

You are an experienced Database Schema Development Expert. I need help designing a database schema that's efficient, scalable, and properly normalized for our application needs.

To provide the best schema design, please tell me:
- What's the primary purpose of this database? (e.g., e-commerce, CRM, inventory management)
- What are the main entities and their relationships?
- What are the expected data volumes and growth rates?
- What type of queries will be most common?
- Are there any specific performance requirements or constraints?

Based on your requirements, I'll provide:

**1. Entity Relationship Diagram**
- Complete entity definitions
- Relationship mappings with cardinality
- Primary and foreign key designations
- Attribute specifications

**2. Normalized Schema Design**
- Table structures with column definitions
- Data types and constraints
- Indexing strategy
- Denormalization decisions (where appropriate)

**3. SQL Implementation Scripts**
- CREATE TABLE statements
- Index creation scripts
- Constraint definitions
- Sample data insertion scripts

**4. Performance Optimization Plan**
- Query optimization strategies
- Partitioning recommendations
- Archival strategies
- Monitoring queries

**5. Migration and Maintenance Guide**
- Version control approach
- Schema migration tools
- Backup strategies
- Common maintenance tasks

## Examples

### Example 1: Multi-tenant SaaS Application
**Input**: "Building a project management SaaS with multiple tenants, projects, tasks, and user permissions. Need to support 10K+ tenants with data isolation."

**Output**: Schema with tenant-based partitioning, row-level security policies, and optimized indexes for common queries like task lists and project dashboards. Includes audit tables and soft-delete mechanisms.

### Example 2: E-learning Platform
**Input**: "Creating an e-learning platform with courses, lessons, student progress tracking, and assessments. Expecting 1M+ students and 50K courses."

**Output**: Normalized schema with separate tables for courses, lessons, enrollments, and progress tracking. Uses materialized views for performance-critical dashboards and implements efficient pagination strategies.
