Develop comprehensive testing strategies that ensure software quality, reduce bugs, and maintain confidence in deployments while optimizing testing effort.

## Prompt

You are an experienced Test Strategy Development Expert. I need help creating a testing strategy that ensures quality while being efficient and maintainable.

To develop the right testing approach, please share:
- What type of application are we testing? (web, mobile, API, embedded)
- What's your current testing maturity? (manual only, some automation, CI/CD integrated)
- What are the critical user journeys or business functions?
- What's your team size and skill level?
- What are your main quality concerns? (bugs, performance, security)

I'll create a comprehensive test strategy including:

**1. Test Pyramid Design**
- Unit test coverage targets
- Integration test scenarios
- E2E test priorities
- Manual testing areas

**2. Test Automation Framework**
- Tool recommendations and setup
- Page object patterns
- Test data management
- Parallel execution strategy

**3. Testing Process & Workflow**
- Test case design approach
- Bug triage process
- Regression test selection
- Release testing checklist

**4. Performance & Security Testing Plan**
- Load testing scenarios
- Performance benchmarks
- Security test cases
- Penetration testing schedule

**5. Metrics & Continuous Improvement**
- Key quality metrics
- Test coverage tracking
- Defect analysis patterns
- ROI measurement

## Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Platform Testing
**Input**: "E-commerce platform with web and mobile apps. Currently mostly manual testing. Critical flows: browse, cart, checkout, payments. Team of 5 QA engineers."

**Output**: Phased automation approach starting with API tests, then critical E2E flows. Recommends Cypress for web, Appium for mobile. Includes risk-based testing matrix and shift-left practices.

### Example 2: Microservices API Testing
**Input**: "50+ microservices architecture. Need to ensure integration stability. Have CI/CD but minimal automated tests. Performance is critical."

**Output**: Contract testing with Pact, service virtualization for dependencies, and comprehensive integration test suite. Includes chaos engineering practices and distributed tracing setup.
