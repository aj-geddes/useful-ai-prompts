# Technical Templates

This directory contains pure technical instruction templates - these are structured implementation guides rather than conversational prompts. These templates provide step-by-step instructions for setting up, configuring, and implementing technical solutions.

## Available Templates

### Development & CI/CD

- [Execution Instructions](./execution-instructions.md) - Development workflow and execution guidelines
- [Python Project CI/CD](./python-project-ci-cd.md) - Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for Python projects
- [MCP Enabler Comprehensive](./mcp-enabler-comprehensive.md) - MCP integration setup and configuration

### Infrastructure & DevOps

- [Docker Production Patterns](./docker-production-patterns.md) - Production-ready Docker containerization
- [FastMCP Server Patterns](./fastmcp-server-patterns.md) - FastMCP server implementation patterns

### Code Quality & Review

- [Code Review Prompts](./code-review-prompts.md) - Automated code review system setup

### Research & Architecture

- [ADR Research Framework](./adr-research-framework.md) - Architectural Decision Record research methodology

## Template vs. Prompt Distinction

**Technical Templates** (this directory):

- Pure instruction sets for implementation
- Step-by-step setup guides
- Configuration templates
- No conversational interaction

**Technical Prompts** (../technical/):

- Conversational AI prompts (start with "You are...")
- Interactive assistance workflows
- User-facing AI personas
- Conversational problem-solving

## Usage

These templates are meant to be used as reference guides for implementing technical solutions. They provide comprehensive instructions, best practices, and configuration examples for various technical domains.
