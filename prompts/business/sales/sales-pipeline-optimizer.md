**Team and tools:**
9. How many salespeople do you have?
10. What CRM/tools are you using?

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. B2B software - CRM for small businesses, $200-500/month subscriptions
2. Average 30-45 days from first contact to close
3. Currently 150 deals in pipeline, worth about $2M total
4. Average deal size $15K annual contract value

5. Stages: Lead ‚Üí Qualified ‚Üí Demo ‚Üí Proposal ‚Üí Negotiation ‚Üí Closed Won/Lost
6. Big drop-offs after demo (40% loss) and at proposal stage (30% loss)
7. Overall conversion from lead to close is 15%
8. Basic BANT qualification, but inconsistently applied

9. 8 salespeople - 2 senior, 4 mid-level, 2 junior
10. Using Salesforce, some use Gong for calls, email tracking with Outreach
11. Forecast based on stage probability multipliers, often miss by 20-30%
12. Long sales cycles, inconsistent follow-up, deals go dark, price objections
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your B2B CRM sales pipeline, here's a comprehensive optimization strategy:

## PIPELINE ANALYSIS

### Current Pipeline Health

**Pipeline Metrics**:
```
Total Pipeline: $2M
Average Deal: $15K
Deals in Pipe: 133 deals
Velocity: 30-45 days

Conversion Funnel:
Lead: 100% ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
           ‚ñº  ‚îÇ 60% pass
Qualified: 60% ‚î§
           ‚ñº  ‚îÇ 60% pass (40% drop)
Demo: 36% ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
           ‚ñº  ‚îÇ 70% pass (30% drop)
Proposal: 25% ‚îÄ‚î§
           ‚ñº  ‚îÇ 80% pass
Negotiation: 20%‚î§
           ‚ñº  ‚îÇ 75% pass
Closed Won: 15%‚îÄ‚îò
```

### Key Problems Identified

1. **Demo ‚Üí Proposal Drop (40%)**: Poor demo-to-need matching
2. **Proposal ‚Üí Close Drop (30%)**: Price shock, no urgency
3. **Forecast Accuracy (¬±20-30%)**: Stage probabilities wrong
4. **Deal Velocity**: Too many stalled deals in pipeline

## OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY

### Stage-by-Stage Improvements

**1. Lead ‚Üí Qualified (Currently 60%)**

*Problem*: Inconsistent BANT application
*Solution*: Implement MEDDIC qualification

```
MEDDIC Scorecard:
M - Metrics: What KPIs will improve? (Score: 0-10)
E - Economic Buyer: Have we identified them? (Y/N)
D - Decision Criteria: What's important? (List)
D - Decision Process: Who/how/when? (Mapped)
I - Identify Pain: Quantified problem? ($value)
C - Champion: Internal advocate? (Name/role)

Minimum score to advance: 35/60
```

**2. Qualified ‚Üí Demo (Currently 60%)**

*Problem*: Generic demos not resonating
*Solution*: Personalized demo framework

```
Pre-Demo Checklist:
‚ñ° Discovery call completed
‚ñ° 3 specific pain points identified
‚ñ° ROI calculation prepared
‚ñ° Custom demo script created
‚ñ° Success metrics defined
‚ñ° Decision maker confirmed attending
```

**Demo Structure**:
1. Confirm pain (5 min)
2. Show specific solution (15 min)
3. Demonstrate ROI (5 min)
4. Discuss implementation (5 min)
5. Clear next steps (5 min)

**3. Demo ‚Üí Proposal (Currently 60%)**

*Problem*: Losing momentum post-demo
*Solution*: Immediate follow-up process

```
Post-Demo Automation:
T+1 hour: Thank you + recording
T+1 day: Customized one-pager
T+2 days: ROI calculator
T+3 days: Case study
T+5 days: Proposal or disqualify
```

**4. Proposal ‚Üí Negotiation (Currently 70%)**

*Problem*: Price shock, no urgency
*Solution*: Value-based proposals

```
Proposal Components:
1. Executive Summary (their words)
2. Current State Pain ($$$)
3. Future State Vision
4. Implementation Plan
5. ROI Timeline (break-even <6 months)
6. Investment Options (3 tiers)
7. Success Guarantee
8. Expiration Date (creates urgency)
```

## FORECASTING MODEL

### Improved Stage Probabilities

Replace generic probabilities with data-driven model:

**Old Model** (Inaccurate):
- Qualified: 20%
- Demo: 40%
- Proposal: 60%
- Negotiation: 80%

**New Model** (Based on your data):
```
Base Probabilities:
- Qualified: 15%
- Demo Scheduled: 25%
- Demo Completed: 35%
- Proposal Sent: 45%
- Proposal Accepted: 65%
- Contract Sent: 85%

Modifiers:
+ Enterprise Account: +10%
+ Champion Identified: +15%
+ Competition: -20%
+ Budget Confirmed: +20%
+ Timeline <30 days: +15%
```

### Weekly Forecast Accuracy

Implement "Commit/Best Case/Pipeline" forecasting:

```
Commit (90% confidence):
- Contract in hand
- Verbal commitment
- PO process started
= $150K this month

Best Case (50% confidence):
- Proposal accepted
- Final negotiations
- Decision this month
= $300K this month

Pipeline (25% confidence):
- Active proposals
- Demos scheduled
= $500K this month
```

## ACCELERATION TACTICS

### Deal Velocity Improvements

**1. Parallel Processing**
Instead of sequential stages, run in parallel:
```
Traditional: Discovery ‚Üí Demo ‚Üí Proposal ‚Üí Close (45 days)
Optimized: Discovery + Demo prep ‚Üí Demo + Proposal draft ‚Üí Close (25 days)
```

**2. Time-Based Automation**
```python
# Stalled Deal Alerts
If no_activity > 5 days:
  - Alert rep
  - Suggest action
  - Auto-draft follow-up

If in_stage > 2x_average:
  - Manager review
  - Escalation path
  - Recovery plan
```

**3. Fast-Track Criteria**
Identify and accelerate ideal customers:
- Budget confirmed
- Pain quantified >$50K/year
- Decision maker engaged
- Timeline <30 days
‚Üí Assign to senior rep, daily standup

### Objection Prevention

**Price Objection Handling**:
```
Prevention:
1. Anchor high in discovery ("companies typically invest $30-50K")
2. Build value before price ($100K problem for $15K solution)
3. Offer payment terms (monthly vs. annual)

Response Framework:
"I understand price is important. Let's make sure we're comparing apples to apples..."
‚Üí Reframe to ROI
‚Üí Compare to cost of problem
‚Üí Offer different package
```
