4. What's your geographic scope?

**Performance metrics:**
5. What are your current service levels?
6. What's your inventory turnover?
7. What percentage of revenue is supply chain cost?
8. Any recent disruptions or challenges?

**Strategic goals:**
9. What are your cost reduction targets?
10. What service improvements do you need?
11. Any sustainability or compliance requirements?
12. What's your budget and timeline?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**NETWORK ANALYSIS** - Current state assessment and opportunities
**OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY** - Cost reduction and service improvement
**INVENTORY PLAN** - Right-sizing stock levels and positioning
**RISK MITIGATION** - Building resilience and contingencies
**IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP** - Phased approach with quick wins

Share your supply chain details and let's optimize for success!

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Consumer electronics - smartphones, tablets, accessories. Complex supply chain
2. 200+ suppliers in Asia, 3 manufacturing plants, 8 regional DCs, selling globally
3. High inventory costs ($50M tied up), frequent stockouts of popular items, long lead times
4. Manufacturing in China/Vietnam, distribution worldwide, 60% sales US/Europe

5. 85% order fill rate (target 95%), 3-5 day delivery, lots of expedited shipping
6. Inventory turns only 4x/year (industry average 8x), 20% obsolescence annually
7. Supply chain is 18% of revenue (vs 12% for competitors), mostly inventory and freight
8. Port delays, chip shortages, demand volatility post-COVID

9. Need to reduce costs by 20% ($30M annually) while improving service
10. 95% fill rate, 2-day delivery for key markets, reduce stockouts by 50%
11. Carbon neutral shipping by 2025, conflict mineral compliance
12. $5M investment budget, need results within 12 months
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your consumer electronics supply chain, here's a comprehensive optimization strategy:

## NETWORK ANALYSIS

### Current State Assessment

**Network Complexity**:
```
Supply Chain Map:
├── Suppliers: 200+ (excessive fragmentation)
│   ├── Component suppliers: ~150
│   ├── Assembly partners: ~30
│   └── Packaging/accessories: ~20
├── Manufacturing: 3 plants (underutilized)
│   ├── China Plant 1: 60% capacity
│   ├── China Plant 2: 55% capacity
│   └── Vietnam Plant: 70% capacity
└── Distribution: 8 DCs (misaligned with demand)
    ├── 3 in Asia (oversized)
    ├── 3 in Americas (undersized)
    └── 2 in Europe (well-sized)
```

**Performance Gaps**:
- Fill rate 10% below target (losing $15M in sales)
- Inventory 2x higher than needed ($25M excess)
- Freight costs 40% above benchmark
- Lead times 2x longer than competitors

### Opportunity Identification

**Quick Wins** (0-3 months, $8M savings):
1. **Inventory Redistribution**: Move $10M stock from Asia to US/EU DCs
2. **Supplier Consolidation**: Reduce to 100 strategic suppliers
3. **Freight Optimization**: Shift 30% air to ocean freight
4. **SKU Rationalization**: Eliminate bottom 20% SKUs

**Strategic Improvements** (3-12 months, $22M savings):
1. **Network Redesign**: Optimize DC locations and inventory
2. **Demand Planning**: Implement ML-based forecasting
3. **Manufacturing Strategy**: Nearshore 30% for key markets
4. **Digital Integration**: End-to-end visibility platform

## OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY

### Network Redesign

**Proposed Network**:
```
Optimized Structure:
├── Strategic Suppliers: 100 (50% reduction)
│   ├── Tier 1 Partners: 20 (80% of spend)
│   ├── Regional Suppliers: 50
│   └── Specialty Suppliers: 30
├── Manufacturing: Regional strategy
│   ├── Asia: 60% (cost products)
│   ├── Mexico: 25% (US fast-turn)
│   └── Eastern Europe: 15% (EU market)
└── Distribution: Market-aligned
    ├── US: 2 major DCs + 3PL
    ├── Europe: 2 DCs + cross-dock
    └── Asia: 1 consolidation center
```

**Cost Impact**:
- Manufacturing: -$12M (nearshoring efficiency)
- Inventory: -$10M (50% reduction)
- Transportation: -$8M (mode optimization)
- Total Annual Savings: $30M

### Service Level Improvement

**Fill Rate Enhancement**:
```
Current vs. Target Performance:
                Current  Target  Strategy
Fill Rate:      85%     95%     Safety stock optimization
Lead Time:      5 days  2 days  Regional fulfillment
Stockouts:      15%     7.5%    Better forecasting
Perfect Order:  70%     90%     Process improvement
```

## INVENTORY PLAN

### Optimization Strategy

**ABC-XYZ Analysis**:
```
Inventory Segmentation:
A-X (High value, stable): 20% SKUs, 50% value
  → Strategy: Low stock, frequent replenishment
A-Y (High value, variable): 15% SKUs, 30% value
  → Strategy: Buffer stock, demand sensing
B-Z (Med value, unpredictable): 25% SKUs, 15% value
  → Strategy: Make-to-order, postponement
C-Z (Low value, sporadic): 40% SKUs, 5% value
  → Strategy: Eliminate or centralize
```

**Inventory Positioning**:
```
Multi-Echelon Optimization:
Raw Materials: 30 days (at suppliers)
Work-in-Process: 7 days (in factories)
Finished Goods:
├── Fast movers: 14 days (regional DCs)
├── Medium movers: 21 days (consolidation centers)
└── Slow movers: Made-to-order only

Total Reduction: $25M (from $50M to $25M)
```

### Demand Planning Enhancement

**Forecasting Improvement**:
- Current accuracy: 60% MAPE
- ML-based forecast: 85% accuracy
- Demand sensing: Real-time adjustments
- Collaborative planning with retailers

**Results**:
- 30% reduction in safety stock
- 50% fewer stockouts
- 20% less obsolescence

## RISK MITIGATION

### Supply Chain Resilience

**Risk Assessment Matrix**:
```
Critical Risks:
1. Single-source components (High impact/probability)
   → Mitigation: Dual sourcing for top 20 components
2. Port congestion (High/Medium)
   → Mitigation: Alternative routing, safety stock
3. Demand volatility (Medium/High)
   → Mitigation: Flexible capacity, postponement
4. Geopolitical (Medium/Medium)
   → Mitigation: Regional diversification
```

**Resilience Strategy**:
1. **Supplier Diversification**: No supplier >20% of spend
2. **Inventory Buffers**: Strategic stock for critical items
3. **Flexible Manufacturing**: 20% surge capacity
4. **Alternative Logistics**: Pre-qualified backup routes

### Business Continuity

**Contingency Plans**:
- Supplier failure: 30-day coverage + alternatives
- Facility disruption: Production shifting capability
- Transportation crisis: Multi-modal options
- Demand spike: Rapid scaling protocols
