## Prompt

```
I'll help you excel as an operations manager by creating systematic approaches to efficiency and team performance. Let me understand your situation:

**About your operations:**
1. What type of operations do you manage? (manufacturing, service, logistics, etc.)
2. How many people are on your team?
3. What are your main operational processes?
4. What does a typical day/week look like for you?

**Current challenges:**
5. What's your biggest operational headache right now?
6. Where do you see the most waste or inefficiency?
7. How is your team's performance and morale?
8. What metrics are you struggling to improve?

**Goals and constraints:**
9. What would success look like in 6 months?
10. What's your budget for improvements?
11. Any regulatory or compliance requirements?
12. What tools and technology do you currently use?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**OPERATIONS ASSESSMENT** - Current state analysis with improvement opportunities
**PROCESS OPTIMIZATION** - Streamlined workflows and waste elimination
**TEAM DEVELOPMENT** - Leadership strategies and performance management
**METRICS DASHBOARD** - KPIs and tracking systems for continuous improvement
**IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP** - Step-by-step improvement plan with timelines

Tell me about your operations challenges and goals.

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. E-commerce fulfillment center, 200,000 orders/month
2. 45 people across receiving, picking, packing, shipping
3. Inventory management, order processing, shipping, returns
4. Firefighting mode - constant crisis management, long hours

5. Can't keep up with growth, errors increasing, staff burnout
6. Too much manual tracking, redundant steps, waiting between stations  
7. High turnover (30%), overtime burnout, low engagement scores
8. Order accuracy (92% vs 98% target), on-time shipping (87% vs 95%)

9. Scale to 300K orders/month with better accuracy and team satisfaction
10. $200K for improvements this year
11. Nothing major, but customer data protection requirements
12. Basic WMS, Excel tracking, email communications, handheld scanners

Issues:
- Peak season chaos, inventory discrepancies
- New hires take 6 weeks to get productive
- Returns processing is completely manual
- Quality control is inconsistent
- No clear accountability for errors
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your 200K orders/month fulfillment operation with scaling and accuracy challenges, here's your operations excellence plan:

## OPERATIONS ASSESSMENT

### CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

**Performance Gaps:**
```
Metric               Current    Target    Gap       Root Cause
Order Accuracy       92%        98%       -6%       Manual processes
On-Time Shipping     87%        95%       -8%       Capacity constraints  
Staff Turnover       30%        15%       +15%      Burnout/poor training
Training Time        6 weeks    3 weeks   +3 weeks  No structured program
```

**Process Efficiency Audit:**
- **Receiving**: 15% time wasted on data entry
- **Picking**: 25% walking time due to layout issues  
- **Packing**: 20% rework due to quality issues
- **Shipping**: 30% delays waiting for carrier pickup

**Key Issues Identified:**
1. **System Integration**: Manual handoffs between systems
2. **Layout Optimization**: Inefficient warehouse flow
3. **Quality Control**: Reactive instead of preventive
4. **Staff Development**: Sink-or-swim training approach

## PROCESS OPTIMIZATION PLAN

### WORKFLOW REDESIGN

**New Standard Operating Procedures:**

**1. Receiving Process (Target: 50% faster)**
```
OLD: Receive → Manual count → Excel entry → WMS update → Putaway
NEW: Receive → Scan → Auto-count verification → Direct WMS → Putaway

Time Savings: 15 minutes per shipment
Error Reduction: 80% fewer data entry mistakes
```

**2. Pick Path Optimization**
```
CURRENT: Zone picking with batching
IMPROVED: Wave planning with optimized routes
- Group orders by zone and shipping method
- Create pick paths that minimize travel time
- Implement pick-and-pass for large orders

Expected Results: 25% faster pick times
```

**3. Quality Control System**
```
NEW CHECKPOINTS:
├── Receiving: Scan verification (99% accuracy)
├── Picking: Spot checks on 10% of picks  
├── Packing: Weight verification system
└── Shipping: Final scan before carrier

Error Prevention: Catch 95% of issues before shipping
```

### AUTOMATION QUICK WINS
