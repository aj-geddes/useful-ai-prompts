## Description

This prompt helps you identify inefficiencies in your processes and create streamlined workflows that reduce waste, improve quality, and increase speed using proven methodologies.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you optimize your processes using proven methodologies to eliminate waste and improve efficiency. Let me understand your current situation:

**About your process:**
1. What specific process needs optimization? (order fulfillment, customer service, manufacturing, etc.)
2. How many steps are currently involved?
3. How many people touch this process?
4. What's the current cycle time from start to finish?

**Current challenges:**
5. What problems are you experiencing? (delays, errors, rework, bottlenecks)
6. Where do you think the biggest inefficiencies are?
7. How much does poor performance cost you? (time, money, customer impact)
8. What metrics are you currently tracking?

**Goals and constraints:**
9. What does "success" look like for this process?
10. What's your budget for improvements?
11. Any constraints? (regulatory, technology, staff limitations)
12. How quickly do you need to see results?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**PROCESS ANALYSIS** - Current state mapping with waste identification
**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS** - Why problems occur and their business impact
**OPTIMIZED WORKFLOW** - Streamlined process with eliminated waste
**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN** - Step-by-step improvement roadmap
**MEASUREMENT SYSTEM** - KPIs and monitoring for sustained improvement

Describe your process challenges and I'll help you create a more efficient system.

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Customer onboarding for our SaaS product
2. Currently 23 steps from signup to first value delivery
3. 6 different people/departments involved (sales, ops, tech, support, billing)
4. Takes 3-5 weeks on average, sometimes up to 8 weeks

5. Customers frustrated with delays, internal team stressed about handoffs
6. Too many approvals, unclear handoffs, duplicate data entry, waiting
7. 30% customer churn before going live, $50K lost revenue per month
8. Only tracking total time, not step-by-step bottlenecks

9. Reduce to 10 days max, 95% customer satisfaction, smooth handoffs
10. $100K budget for process improvements
11. Need to maintain compliance checks, limited tech dev resources
12. Need improvements within 3 months for renewal season

Current mess:
- Sales promises 2 weeks, but ops needs 4-6 weeks
- Customer data entered 3 times in different systems
- Legal review takes 5-7 days for standard contracts
- Technical setup waiting on manual provisioning
- No clear owner when things go wrong
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your SaaS onboarding process with 23 steps and 3-5 week delays, here's your optimization plan:

## CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### WASTE IDENTIFICATION (Using Lean 8 Wastes)

| Waste Type | Current Issues | Impact |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| **Waiting** | Legal review queue (5-7 days) | 30% of total cycle time |
| **Overprocessing** | 3x data entry, duplicate approvals | 15 hours/customer |
| **Motion** | Email ping-pong between teams | 40 emails/customer |
| **Defects** | Unclear requirements causing rework | 25% of projects need rework |
| **Inventory** | 15+ customers in various queue stages | Cash flow impact |
| **Transportation** | Information handoffs between systems | Data integrity issues |
| **Overproduction** | Custom docs for standard features | 8 hours/customer |
| **Human Potential** | No process ownership or improvement ideas | Low team engagement |

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### PRIMARY ISSUES

**1. Handoff Problems (40% of delays)**
- **Root Cause**: No defined handoff criteria or process
- **Impact**: 6-8 day delays at each transition
- **Cost**: $20K lost revenue per month

**2. Manual Data Entry (25% of delays)**  
- **Root Cause**: Systems not integrated
- **Impact**: Errors requiring rework, delayed start
- **Cost**: 45 hours staff time per customer

**3. Legal Review Bottleneck (30% of delays)**
- **Root Cause**: All contracts treated as custom
- **Impact**: 5-7 day queue even for standard deals
- **Cost**: $15K lost revenue per month

**4. No Process Visibility (20% of delays)**
- **Root Cause**: No tracking system for customer status
- **Impact**: Customer anxiety, internal confusion
- **Cost**: 30% pre-go-live churn
