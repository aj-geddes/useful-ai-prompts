## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Regulatory Risk Matrix

**Critical Risks** (Immediate action required):
```
AML/KYC Compliance:
├── Current state: Manual processes, previous warning
├── Risk level: CRITICAL
├── Impact: Fines, license revocation, criminal liability
└── Priority actions: Automate screening, enhance documentation

Cross-Border Regulations:
├── Current state: No EU framework yet
├── Risk level: HIGH (increasing with expansion)
├── Impact: Market entry delays, penalties
└── Priority actions: EU compliance framework before launch

AI/Fair Lending:
├── Current state: No governance framework
├── Risk level: HIGH
├── Impact: Discrimination claims, CFPB enforcement
└── Priority actions: AI governance, bias testing, documentation
```

**Moderate Risks**:
- Data privacy compliance gaps
- Third-party vendor oversight
- Regulatory change management
- Compliance resource constraints

## COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK

### Governance Structure

**Three Lines of Defense Model**:

```
Board Oversight
    │
    ├── 1st Line: Business Operations
    │   ├── Product teams (embedded controls)
    │   ├── Customer service (KYC execution)
    │   └── IT (data security controls)
    │
    ├── 2nd Line: Compliance & Risk
    │   ├── Chief Compliance Officer
    │   ├── Compliance team (expand to 6-8)
    │   ├── Risk management function
    │   └── Legal support
    │
    └── 3rd Line: Internal Audit
        └── Independent assurance (outsourced initially)
```

**Recommended Structure**:
1. Elevate CCO to report directly to CEO and Board
2. Create Board Risk & Compliance Committee
3. Establish Compliance Champions in each business unit
4. Form Product Approval Committee for new offerings
