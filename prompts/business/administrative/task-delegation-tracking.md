This prompt helps you effectively delegate tasks, track progress, and ensure accountability while developing your team's capabilities and protecting your time.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you create an effective delegation and tracking system. Let me understand your situation:

**About your team and role:**
1. What's your position and how many people report to you?
2. What types of tasks do you typically need to delegate?
3. How experienced are your team members?
4. What's your current method for tracking delegated tasks?

**Current delegation challenges:**
5. What tasks do you find hardest to delegate?
6. How often do delegated tasks come back incomplete or late?
7. What percentage of your time is spent on follow-ups?
8. Any team members struggling with accountability?

**Goals and preferences:**
9. What tasks would you most like to get off your plate?
10. How much detail do you prefer in progress updates?
11. What's your preferred communication method? (email, Slack, meetings)
12. How do you want to handle quality control and feedback?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**DELEGATION FRAMEWORK** - Smart task assignment based on skills/capacity
**TRACKING SYSTEM** - Progress monitoring without micromanaging  
**ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURE** - Clear expectations and check-in schedules
**DEVELOPMENT PLAN** - Building team capabilities for future delegation
**COMMUNICATION TEMPLATES** - Scripts for delegation and follow-up

Please describe your current delegation situation and what you'd like to improve.

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. VP of Operations, 8 direct reports across 3 departments
2. Project coordination, budget reviews, vendor management, team development
3. Mix: 3 senior (5+ years), 3 mid-level (2-3 years), 2 new hires (< 6 months)
4. Mostly email follow-ups and weekly 1-on-1s, pretty informal

5. Strategic planning, client presentations, budget decisions
6. About 30% come back needing rework or are delivered late
7. Probably 25% of my time is spent checking on things
8. Two mid-level people miss deadlines frequently

Current situation:
- I dump tasks via email with rough deadlines
- Follow-up is reactive when things go wrong
- No clear handoff process or expectations
- Quality is inconsistent across team members
- I end up doing stuff myself to meet deadlines
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your VP role with 8 reports and 30% rework rate, here's your delegation optimization system:
