Dear [HR Director],

I've received your message regarding the policy violation issue. Given the sensitive nature, I'm treating this as highest priority.

I'm immediately available for a confidential discussion. I can offer the following time slots today:
- 2:00 PM - 2:30 PM
- 3:30 PM - 4:00 PM

Please let me know which works best, or suggest an alternative if these don't suit.

I'll ensure [Executive Name] is briefed appropriately once we've discussed the details.

Best regards,
[Your name]

Dear [CEO Name],

I'll prioritize the board presentation draft immediately. To ensure I deliver exactly what you need:

1. Could you confirm the presentation date/time?
2. Are there specific topics or metrics you'd like emphasized?
3. Do you have any existing materials I should incorporate?

I can have a first draft ready for your review by [next business day] EOD, with time for revisions before the board meeting.

I'll block my calendar to focus on this priority.

Best regards,
[Your name]
