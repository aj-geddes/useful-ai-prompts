## Description

This prompt helps you conduct strategic business analysis that drives organizational improvement through data-driven insights, process optimization, and effective solution design.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you conduct strategic business analysis to drive meaningful improvements. Let me understand your situation:

**Business context:**
1. What business problem or opportunity are you analyzing?
2. What's the current state vs desired future state?
3. Who are the key stakeholders affected?
4. What's driving the need for change?

**Analysis scope:**
5. What processes or systems are involved?
6. What data do you have access to?
7. What constraints exist? (budget, time, resources)
8. Any previous attempts to address this?

**Strategic considerations:**
9. How does this align with organizational strategy?
10. What are the success criteria?
11. What risks need to be considered?
12. What's the expected ROI or value?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS** - Root cause and opportunity assessment
**SOLUTION OPTIONS** - Alternative approaches with trade-offs
**BUSINESS CASE** - Quantified benefits and implementation plan
**ROADMAP** - Phased approach to achieve desired state
**SUCCESS METRICS** - KPIs to track progress and value

Share your business challenge and let's develop actionable insights!
```

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. High customer churn rate - losing 25% annually vs industry average 15%
2. Current: Reactive support, siloed data, no predictive insights. Desired: Proactive engagement, integrated view, <15% churn
3. Stakeholders: Customer Success, Sales, Product, Finance, IT, Executive team
4. Revenue impact ($5M lost/year), competitor advantages, investor concerns

5. CRM, support tickets, billing system, product usage data - all separate
6. 3 years of data across systems, customer surveys, some analytics
7. $500K budget, 6-month timeline, limited IT resources, can't change core systems
8. Tried basic email campaigns last year, minimal impact (2% improvement)

9. Company goal: 20% revenue growth, improve customer lifetime value
10. Success: Reduce churn to 15%, increase NPS by 10 points, positive ROI in 12 months
11. Risks: Data quality issues, change resistance, integration complexity
12. Expect $3M annual savings from reduced churn, plus upsell opportunities
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your customer churn challenge, here's a strategic analysis and action plan:

## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS

### Root Cause Analysis

**Churn Driver Breakdown**:
```
Primary Factors (Data Analysis):
├── Poor Onboarding (35% of churn)
│   └── No usage after 30 days
├── Support Issues (25% of churn)
│   └── >3 tickets unresolved
├── Feature Gaps (20% of churn)
│   └── Competitor switching
├── Price Sensitivity (15% of churn)
│   └── No value realization
└── Unknown (5% of churn)
```

**Systemic Issues Identified**:
1. **Data Silos**: Customer insights fragmented across 5 systems
2. **Reactive Model**: Action only after problems escalate
3. **No Early Warning**: Missing predictive indicators
4. **Value Gap**: Customers don't see ROI within 90 days

### Opportunity Assessment

**Quick Wins** (0-3 months):
- Unified customer health score
- At-risk customer alerts
- Proactive outreach playbooks

**Strategic Improvements** (3-6 months):
- Predictive churn model
- Automated interventions
- Success team enablement

**Competitive Advantages**:
- First-mover in predictive retention
- Superior customer intelligence
- Proactive vs reactive approach

## SOLUTION OPTIONS

### Option 1: Customer Intelligence Platform (Recommended)

**Approach**: Integrate data sources into unified platform with predictive analytics

**Components**:
```
Data Integration Layer
├── ETL from 5 systems
├── Real-time sync
└── Data quality engine

Analytics Engine
├── Health scoring
├── Churn prediction
├── Segmentation
└── Next best action

Action Layer
├── Automated alerts
├── Workflow triggers
├── Success playbooks
└── ROI tracking
```

**Pros**:
- Addresses root cause (data silos)
- Scalable solution
- 85% churn prediction accuracy

**Cons**:
- Higher upfront investment
- 4-month implementation
- Requires change management

**Investment**: $350K
**ROI**: 14 months

### Option 2: Point Solutions

**Approach**: Deploy separate tools for specific problems

**Components**:
- Email automation for onboarding
- Support ticket prioritization
- Basic reporting dashboard
- Manual health checks

**Pros**:
- Faster deployment (2 months)
- Lower cost ($150K)
- Less change required

**Cons**:
- Doesn't solve core issue
- Limited improvement (5-7%)
- Not scalable

### Option 3: Enhanced Manual Process

**Approach**: Hire success managers, improve processes

**Pros**:
- Quick start
- Flexible approach

**Cons**:
- Not scalable
- High ongoing cost
- Inconsistent results

## BUSINESS CASE

### Financial Analysis

**Current State Costs**:
```
Annual Churn Impact:
- Lost Revenue: $5M (500 customers × $10K average)
- Acquisition Costs: $1.5M (replacement customers)
- Total Annual Loss: $6.5M
```

**Future State Benefits**:
```
Churn Reduction (25% → 15%):
- Revenue Retained: $3M annually
- Reduced Acquisition: $900K annually
- Upsell Opportunity: $500K (better engagement)
- Total Annual Benefit: $4.4M
```

**ROI Calculation**:
```
Year 1: -$350K (investment) + $2.2M (6-month benefit) = $1.85M
Year 2: $4.4M benefit - $50K (maintenance) = $4.35M
3-Year NPV: $8.2M
ROI: 440% (Year 2)
```

### Risk-Adjusted Scenario

**Conservative (70% success)**:
- Year 1: $1.3M
- ROI: 18 months

**Optimistic (full success + upsell)**:
- Year 1: $2.5M
- ROI: 10 months
