## Description
A behavioral change specialist that helps you build lasting positive habits and eliminate negative ones using science-backed strategies tailored to your personality and circumstances.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you create and stick to habits that align with your goals using proven behavioral science principles. Let me understand your specific situation and design a personalized habit formation strategy.

**Current Habit Assessment:**
1. What specific habit(s) do you want to build or break?
2. How many times have you tried to establish this habit before?
3. What usually causes you to abandon new habits?
4. What positive habits do you currently maintain successfully?
5. What time of day do you have the most willpower and consistency?

**Motivation and Context:**
6. Why is this habit important to you right now?
7. How will your life improve when this habit is established?
8. What's currently happening instead of your desired habit?
9. Who in your life would support or notice this change?
10. What would be the cost of not developing this habit?

**Lifestyle and Constraints:**
11. What does your typical daily routine look like?
12. Where do you plan to practice this habit? (home, office, gym, etc.)
13. What tools or resources do you need for this habit?
14. How much time can you realistically dedicate initially?
15. What might interfere with your habit practice?

**Personal Behavior Patterns:**
16. Do you respond better to rewards or accountability?
17. Are you more motivated by progress tracking or just doing it?
18. Do you prefer starting big or starting tiny?
19. How do you typically handle setbacks or failures?
20. What personality traits help or hinder your consistency?

Based on your responses, I'll provide:

**1. HABIT DESIGN BLUEPRINT**

- Environmental design recommendations
- Trigger and reward system setup
- Difficulty progression pathway

**2. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your perfectionist tendencies and history of all-or-nothing thinking, I've designed a progressive habit system that builds resilience and celebrates imperfection:

## HABIT DESIGN BLUEPRINT

### The "Triple Stack" Progressive System
```
PHASE 1: Foundation (Days 1-14)
Morning Stack:
├── Wake up → 2-minute meditation (sitting on bed edge)
├── Meditation → Put on workout clothes
├── Workout clothes → 5-minute movement (walk/stretch)
└── Movement → Regular coffee routine

Evening Stack:
├── Kids bedtime → Set phone to charge in kitchen
├── Phone away → 5-minute bedroom tidy
└── Tidy → In bed by 10:15 PM
```

### Habit Architecture Design
```
EXERCISE HABIT STRUCTURE:
Minimum Viable Habit: Put on workout clothes + 5 minutes movement
Week 1-2:     5-10 minutes (just show up)
Week 3-4:     10-15 minutes (build consistency)
Week 5-6:     15-20 minutes (increase intensity)
Week 7-8:     20-30 minutes (full target)

SLEEP HABIT STRUCTURE:
Minimum Viable: Phone charging in kitchen by 9:30 PM
Week 1-2:     In bed by 10:15 PM (any activity)
Week 3-4:     Lights out by 10:30 PM
Week 5-6:     Asleep by 10:45 PM
Week 7-8:     Wake up naturally by 6:30 AM

MEDITATION HABIT STRUCTURE:
Minimum Viable: Sit quietly for 1 minute after waking
Week 1-2:     1-2 minutes sitting meditation
Week 3-4:     3-5 minutes guided meditation
Week 5-6:     5-10 minutes focused practice
Week 7-8:     10-15 minutes with variety
```

## PERFECTIONIST-PROOF IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### The "Good Enough" Success Framework
```
DAILY SUCCESS CRITERIA (You only need 2 out of 3):
✓ Morning movement: ANY amount (even 30 seconds counts)
✓ Phone away by 9:30 PM
✓ 1+ minute of intentional quiet time

WEEKLY SUCCESS CRITERIA (You only need 5 out of 7 days):
✓ Completed all three minimum viable habits
✓ No self-criticism for imperfect days
✓ Focused on showing up vs. performance
```

### Anti-Perfectionist Rules
```
GOLDEN RULES FOR SUCCESS:
1. "Something is always better than nothing"
2. "Showing up matters more than duration"
3. "Missing one day is NOT failure"
4. "Lower the bar until consistency is automatic"
5. "Progress over perfection, always"

PERFECTIONIST TRAP SOLUTIONS:
Thought: "I only had 3 minutes to exercise, so why bother?"
Response: "3 minutes maintains my exercise identity"

Thought: "I stayed up late last night, so I've ruined everything"
Response: "Today is a fresh start, yesterday is data"

Thought: "My meditation was distracted and terrible"
Response: "Noticing distraction IS successful meditation"
```

## PSYCHOLOGY-BASED APPROACH

### Identity-Based Habit Formation
```
IDENTITY SHIFTS TO REINFORCE:
Old Identity: "I'm someone who starts things but doesn't finish them"
New Identity: "I'm someone who shows up consistently, even imperfectly"

Old Identity: "I'm not a morning person"
New Identity: "I'm someone who uses mornings for self-care"

Old Identity: "I'm too busy for meditation"
New Identity: "I'm someone who prioritizes mental wellness"

DAILY IDENTITY REINFORCEMENT:
├── Morning: "I am someone who moves my body daily"
├── Evening: "I am someone who prioritizes good sleep"
├── Anytime: "I am someone who handles stress mindfully"
└── Weekly: "I am someone who takes care of my health"
```

### Environmental Design
```
MORNING SETUP (Night Before):
├── Workout clothes laid out beside bed
├── Meditation cushion or chair ready
├── Water bottle filled and placed near clothes
├── Phone in airplane mode until after morning routine
└── Backup 2-minute routine written on index card

EVENING SETUP:
├── Phone charging station in kitchen (not bedroom)
├── Book or magazine by bed for reading
├── Bedroom temperature set to 68°F
├── Blackout curtains or eye mask ready
└── "Tomorrow's priorities" notepad by kitchen charger
```

## TRACKING AND ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM

### Visual Progress Tracking
```
HABIT TRACKER DESIGN:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Week 1: Foundation Building             │
│ M  T  W  T  F  S  S                    │
│ 🟢 🟢 🟡 🟢 🟢 🟢 🔴 Movement        │
│ 🟢 🟢 🟢 🟡 🟢 🟢 🟢 Phone Away     │
│ 🟢 🟡 🟢 🟢 🟢 🟢 🟢 Quiet Time     │
│                                         │
│ 🟢 = Full habit  🟡 = Minimum  🔴 = Miss│
│ Success: 5+ days with 2+ green/yellow   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Weekly Milestone Celebrations
```
WEEK 1 CELEBRATION: Showed up 5+ days
├── Reward: Favorite healthy meal or new workout playlist
├── Reflection: What made it easier to show up?
├── Adjustment: Any tweaks needed for week 2?

WEEK 2 CELEBRATION: Maintained minimum consistency
├── Reward: New meditation app premium or workout gear
├── Reflection: Which habit feels most natural now?
├── Adjustment: Ready to slightly increase one habit?

WEEK 4 CELEBRATION: One month of consistency
├── Reward: Massage, new book, or experience you enjoy
├── Reflection: How do you feel different than a month ago?
├── Planning: Which habit to expand first?
```

### Accountability Partner Protocol
```
WEEKLY CHECK-IN WITH PARTNER (10 minutes):
1. Share last week's tracker (no judgment, just facts)
2. Celebrate any consistency, even imperfect
3. Identify one thing that helped and one challenge
4. Set one tiny goal for the upcoming week
5. Schedule next check-in before ending call

MONTHLY CHECK-IN WITH DOCTOR:
├── Share energy levels and mood changes
├── Discuss any health improvements noticed
├── Get professional validation for progress
└── Adjust goals based on health markers
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING PROTOCOLS

### Common Failure Point Solutions
```
SCENARIO: Travel/Schedule Disruption
├── Pack 5-minute routine backup plan
├── Hotel room or airplane exercises prepared
├── Phone-based meditation for any location
├── Focus on maintaining sleep priority over exercise
└── Restart immediately upon return, no guilt

SCENARIO: Getting Sick
├── Replace exercise with gentle stretching or rest
├── Maintain meditation (might help with healing)
├── Keep sleep schedule even if feeling unwell
├── Count rest as self-care, not habit failure
└── Gradual return to full routine when healthy

SCENARIO: Social/Family Obligations
├── Communicate habits to family as health priorities
├── Find 2-minute versions for busy days
├── Use social events as meditation on mindful presence
├── Maintain sleep time even during social periods
└── Plan habit restart for next normal day
```

### Recovery Strategies
```
AFTER MISSING 1 DAY:
├── No analysis needed, just resume tomorrow
├── Focus on showing up, not making up
├── Remember your identity as someone who's consistent
└── Missing one day doesn't negate previous progress

AFTER MISSING 2-3 DAYS:
├── Lower the bar even further temporarily
├── Do minimum viable version for 3 days straight
├── Reconnect with why these habits matter
├── Consider what triggered the break and plan for it
└── Celebrate restart rather than dwelling on gap

AFTER MISSING A WEEK:
├── Treat as complete restart, no pressure to catch up
├── Review what led to the break without self-judgment
├── Consider if habits need to be smaller/simpler
├── Get accountability partner support for restart
└── Remember: every expert has restarted multiple times
```

## LONG-TERM MAINTENANCE PLANNING

### 90-Day Evolution Path
```
MONTH 1: Consistency Over Performance
├── Focus purely on showing up
├── Celebrate imperfect completion
├── Troubleshoot major obstacles
└── Establish minimum viable habits

MONTH 2: Natural Integration
├── Habits start feeling automatic
├── Gradually increase duration/intensity
├── Connect habits to identity and values
└── Notice life improvements from consistency

MONTH 3: Optimization and Expansion
├── Fine-tune timing and approach
├── Consider adding complementary habits
├── Plan for seasonal changes and challenges
└── Document what works for future reference
```

### Seasonal Adaptation Framework
```
WINTER ADJUSTMENTS:
├── Indoor exercise alternatives ready
├── Earlier bedtime to account for less daylight
├── Vitamin D and light therapy considerations
└── Comfort vs. progress balance

SUMMER ADJUSTMENTS:
├── Earlier morning routine to beat heat
├── Travel and vacation habit modifications
├── Social schedule integration strategies
└── Maintaining consistency during busy seasons

LIFE CHANGE ADAPTATIONS:
├── Job changes: Adjust timing, maintain core habits
├── Family changes: Scale back temporarily, restart gradually
├── Health changes: Medical guidance, modified versions
└── Moving: Re-establish environmental cues quickly
```

Your success lies in embracing "good enough" consistency rather than perfect performance. These habits are designed to grow with you and survive real-life disruptions.

Would you like me to detail specific backup plans for your upcoming work travel or create a custom tracking template for your visual progress preference?
