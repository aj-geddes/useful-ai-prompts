## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Tried GTD, Pomodoro, bullet journaling - each helped but eventually abandoned
2. Currently use Apple Notes, sometimes Todoist, Google Calendar
3. Files scattered across Downloads, Desktop, Google Drive - no real system
4. Start day checking emails, then reactive to whatever comes up
5. Use mental notes mostly, occasionally write project lists

6. Constantly switching between tasks, never feel "done"
7. Important emails get buried, tasks forgotten if not written down immediately
8. Drop everything for urgent requests, lose focus on important work
9. Feeling behind and overwhelmed, can't see the big picture
10. Everything feels urgent, struggle to say no to new requests

11. Feel in control, make steady progress on meaningful work
12. 2-3 hours for initial setup, 15-20 minutes daily maintenance
13. Prefer digital with some analog backup for brainstorming
14. Comfortable with tech but want simple, not complex automation
15. Need to share some projects with team, most work is individual

16. Like flexible frameworks with some structure
17. Gentle reminders, not overwhelming notifications
18. Progress visibility and completing meaningful chunks
19. Break long projects into smaller milestones, batch quick tasks
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your experience with multiple systems and preference for flexible digital frameworks, I'll design a hybrid system that captures the best elements while avoiding the complexity that led to abandonment.

## PERSONALIZED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Core Framework: Modified GTD + Time Blocking
Your system will combine GTD's capture/clarify process with visual time blocking, addressing your need for both organization and flexibility.

**Foundation Principles:**
```
1. TRUSTED CAPTURE: Everything goes into ONE inbox
2. WEEKLY CLARITY: Regular review prevents overwhelm
3. ENERGY ALIGNMENT: Match tasks to your natural rhythms
4. VISIBLE PROGRESS: Clear indicators of advancement
5. GENTLE BOUNDARIES: Protect focus without rigid scheduling
```

### Three-Layer Organization Structure

**Layer 1: Capture (Inbox)**
- Single digital inbox for all inputs
- Quick capture on mobile and desktop
- 24-hour processing rule

**Layer 2: Clarify (Action Lists)**
- Focus (today's 3 priorities)
- Next Actions (ready to do)
- Waiting For (delegated/dependent)
- Someday/Maybe (ideas and future projects)

**Layer 3: Execute (Time Blocks)**
- Morning Deep Work (2-hour protected block)
- Admin Time (email, quick tasks)
- Project Time (meaningful progress)
- Buffer Time (interruptions, unexpected)

## TOOL STACK OPTIMIZATION

### Primary Tools Stack
```
CAPTURE & PLANNING:
- Todoist (cross-platform, natural language, project organization)
- Google Calendar (time blocking, visual schedule)
- Apple Notes (quick capture, brainstorming)

FILE ORGANIZATION:
- Google Drive with PARA Method structure:
  └── Projects (active work)
  └── Areas (ongoing responsibilities)
  └── Resources (reference materials)
  └── Archive (completed/inactive)

COMMUNICATION:
- Email filters and rules for auto-organization
- Slack/Teams status management
- Shared project spaces for collaboration
```

### Automation Workflows
```
EMAIL PROCESSING:
- Auto-filter newsletters to "Read Later" label
- VIP list for important contacts
- Templates for common responses

TASK CREATION:
- Email-to-task forwarding in Todoist
- Calendar events auto-create tasks for preparation
- Location-based reminders for errands

WEEKLY REVIEW:
- Calendar reminder with agenda template
- Automated reports on completed tasks
- Project progress dashboard
```

## DAILY WORKFLOW DESIGN

### Morning Routine (20 minutes)
```
8:00-8:05   Review calendar and adjust time blocks
8:05-8:10   Process inbox to zero (capture new items)
8:10-8:15   Choose 3 Focus items for today
8:15-8:20   Set up workspace, close distractions
```

### Core Time Blocks
```
DEEP WORK BLOCK (9:00-11:00)
- Phone in drawer, notifications off
- Work on #1 priority from Focus list
- No meetings, no email checking
- Use gentle timer for breaks

ADMIN BLOCK (11:15-12:00)
- Process and respond to emails
- Handle quick tasks (<15 minutes)
- Update project statuses
- Schedule meetings/calls

PROJECT BLOCK (1:00-3:00)
- Meaningful progress on ongoing projects
- Creative work, planning, strategic thinking
- Collaborative work if needed
- Document progress and next steps
```

### Evening Wrap-up (10 minutes)
```
5:00-5:05   Capture any loose items in inbox
5:05-5:10   Review today's accomplishments
5:10        Set tomorrow's #1 priority
```

## WEEKLY REVIEW PROCESS

### Friday Review (30 minutes)
```
WEEK REFLECTION:
□ What went well this week?
□ What patterns of interruption emerged?
□ Which time blocks were most productive?
□ What got derailed and why?

NEXT WEEK PLANNING:
□ Review and update project list
□ Identify week's 3 major priorities
□ Schedule important tasks in calendar
□ Prepare Monday's focus session
□ Clear Someday/Maybe list of completed items
```

## HANDLING COMMON CHALLENGES

### Interruption Management
```
URGENT REQUEST PROTOCOL:
1. Ask: "When do you need this by?"
2. Assess: Does this truly need immediate attention?
3. Negotiate: "I can start this at 2 PM, will that work?"
4. Capture: Add to inbox if accepting
5. Protect: Return to focus work
```

### Overwhelm Prevention
```
WEEKLY OVERLOAD SIGNALS:
- Focus list consistently >5 items
- Time blocks regularly overrunning
- Weekend thoughts about undone work
- Physical stress symptoms

RESET PROTOCOL:
- Stop adding new commitments
- Review and defer non-essential items
- Break large tasks into smaller pieces
- Schedule stress recovery time
```

### System Maintenance
```
MONTHLY HEALTH CHECK:
□ Are tools still serving their purpose?
□ Which workflows feel forced vs. natural?
□ What new challenges have emerged?
□ How has workload/life situation changed?

ADAPTATION STRATEGIES:
- Modify time block sizes seasonally
- Adjust priority criteria based on goals
- Simplify tools if complexity increases
- Add or remove system elements based on usage
```
