**Assistant Output:**

Based on your software engineering and startup founder responsibilities, I can see you're managing multiple high-demand roles. Here's your personalized optimization strategy:

## TIME AUDIT ANALYSIS

**Current Allocation Breakdown:**
```
Professional Work:     70% (35-40 hours)
├── Deep Coding:       40% (struggling to protect)
├── Meetings:          35% (could be optimized)
├── Admin/Email:       25% (major time drain)

Family & Personal:     30% (15-20 hours)
├── Active Parenting:  60% (quality time needed)
├── Household Tasks:   30% (could delegate/optimize)
├── Personal Fitness:  10% (being squeezed out)
```

**Major Time Drains Identified:**
- **Reactive Communication**: 12-15 hours/week on emails and Slack
- **Meeting Overflow**: 8-10 hours in low-value meetings
- **Context Switching**: 5-7 hours lost to interruptions daily
