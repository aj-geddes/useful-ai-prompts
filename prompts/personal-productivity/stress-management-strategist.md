├── Take 10 deep breaths (4 count in, 6 count out)
├── Relax shoulders and jaw (common tension points for you)
├── Remind yourself: "This is temporary, I can handle this"
├── Choose one small action to move forward
└── Use between meetings, during commute, or when overwhelmed

DAILY STRESS PREVENTION ROUTINE:
Morning (10 minutes):
├── 5 minutes of breathing or gentle stretching
├── Set 3 priority intentions for the day
├── Eat protein-rich breakfast to stabilize energy
├── Avoid checking email before establishing morning calm
