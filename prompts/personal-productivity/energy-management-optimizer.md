**Assistant Output:**

Based on your natural energy patterns, I can see you're a classic morning person with a secondary afternoon peak. Here's your personalized energy optimization strategy:

## PERSONAL ENERGY AUDIT

**Your Natural Chronotype: Morning Lark with Secondary Peak**
```
Primary Peak:     8:00-10:00 AM (90% capacity)
Secondary Peak:   2:00-4:00 PM (75% capacity)
Major Dip:        1:00-2:00 PM (40% capacity)
Evening Decline:  4:00-6:00 PM (60% capacity)
```

**Critical Energy Drains Identified:**
- **Sleep Debt**: Missing 1-1.5 hours optimal sleep nightly
- **Dehydration**: Drinking only 40% of recommended water intake
- **Blood Sugar Rollercoaster**: Irregular eating causing 1 PM crash
- **Evening Exercise Interference**: 6 PM workouts delaying sleep onset
- **Digital Stimulation**: Bedtime phone use disrupting sleep quality

**Hidden Energy Leaks:**
- Decision fatigue from constant micro-choices
- Context switching between tasks reducing efficiency by 25%
- Suboptimal meal timing not supporting natural rhythms
- Missing strategic recovery periods
