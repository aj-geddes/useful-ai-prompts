I'll help you create a detailed customer journey map. Let me ask you some questions to understand your specific needs:

ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMER:

- What primary goal are they trying to achieve?
- What's their current relationship with your brand? (new, existing, returning)

JOURNEY SCOPE:
- What specific journey are we mapping? (onboarding, purchase, support, renewal)
- Where does this journey begin and end?
- Are there any critical touchpoints we must include?

CURRENT CHALLENGES:
