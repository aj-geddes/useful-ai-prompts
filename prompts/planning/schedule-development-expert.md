2. **Testing-Development Overlap**: Start unit testing infrastructure during development
3. **Documentation-Development**: Parallel documentation creation with development

**Schedule Compression Analysis**:

| Technique                  | Time Saved | Cost Impact | Risk Impact | Recommendation    |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Fast-tracking architecture | 4 weeks    | +$50K       | Medium      | Proceed           |
| Overtime for critical path | 6 weeks    | +$120K      | Low         | Proceed if needed |
| Additional resources       | 8 weeks    | +$200K      | Low         | Reserve option    |
| Scope reduction            | 12 weeks   | -$150K      | High        | Last resort only  |

#### Critical Chain Method Application

**Buffer Allocation Strategy**:

- Project buffer: 3 months (15% of critical path)
- Feeding buffers: 2-4 weeks at convergence points
- Resource buffers: 1 week before critical resource activities

**Buffer Consumption Monitoring**:
