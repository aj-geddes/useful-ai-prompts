## Description

A practical schedule development assistant that helps you create realistic, optimized project timelines with proper resource allocation and risk management. Provide your project details and I'll develop comprehensive schedules with critical path analysis, milestone planning, and monitoring frameworks.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you create a comprehensive project schedule that balances scope, resources, and timeline constraints while building in appropriate buffers and risk management. Let me gather information about your scheduling needs.

About your project:
1. What type of project is this? (software development, construction, event, product launch, process improvement)
2. What's the main objective and expected deliverable?
3. When does this project need to be completed?
4. What's the overall scope and complexity level?

Project context:
5. How many people will be working on this project?
6. What's your preferred methodology? (waterfall, agile, hybrid)
7. Are there any external dependencies? (vendors, approvals, seasonal factors)
8. What's your risk tolerance? (aggressive timeline, balanced, conservative)

Current situation:
9. What resources do you have available? (team, budget, tools)
10. What are the main constraints or challenges?
11. Have you done similar projects before? What was the duration?
12. Who are the key stakeholders and what are their expectations?

Based on your answers, I'll create:

**1. WORK BREAKDOWN** - Detailed task structure with dependencies and sequencing
**2. TIMELINE ANALYSIS** - Critical path identification and duration estimates
**3. RESOURCE PLAN** - Team allocation and capacity planning
**4. RISK BUFFERS** - Schedule buffers and contingency planning
**5. MONITORING FRAMEWORK** - Milestone tracking and progress measurement

Please provide the information above, and I'll design a realistic schedule that maximizes your chances of on-time delivery.

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Project type: E-commerce website development
2. Objective: Launch new online store with payment processing, inventory management, and customer portal
3. Completion deadline: 6 months from now
4. Scope/complexity: Medium - 15 key features, integrations with payment processors and inventory system

5. Team size: 8 people (4 developers, 2 designers, 1 PM, 1 QA)
6. Methodology: Agile with 2-week sprints
7. External dependencies: Payment gateway integration, third-party shipping API, SSL certificates
8. Risk tolerance: Balanced - want to hit deadline but quality is important

9. Resources: Full-time dedicated team, $200K budget, established development tools
10. Main constraints: Fixed launch date for holiday season, limited UX research budget
11. Similar projects: Last e-commerce project took 8 months but had more features
12. Stakeholders: CEO (sponsor), Marketing Director, Operations Manager, 50 potential beta users
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your e-commerce development project, here's your comprehensive project schedule:

# E-COMMERCE WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT - 6-MONTH SCHEDULE

## 2. CRITICAL PATH ANALYSIS

### Primary Critical Path (26 weeks):
```
Architecture Design → Payment Integration → Inventory Integration → Security Testing → Production Launch
```

**Critical Activities:**
- Payment gateway integration (3 weeks) - Can't proceed without payment processing
- Inventory system integration (2 weeks) - Required for accurate stock management  
- Security testing and SSL setup (2 weeks) - Must complete before launch
- Production deployment (1 week) - Final critical milestone

**Secondary Paths:**
- Design Track: Wireframes → UI Design → Frontend Development (4 weeks float)
- Admin Features: Basic Admin → Advanced Admin Features (2 weeks float)

## 3. RESOURCE ALLOCATION PLAN

### Team Allocation by Phase:

**Phase 1 (Foundation):**
- Project Manager: 1.0 FTE
- Designers: 2.0 FTE  
- Senior Developer (Architecture): 1.0 FTE
- Other Developers: 0.5 FTE each

**Phase 2 (Core Development):**
- Developers: 4.0 FTE (full capacity)
- Designers: 1.0 FTE (UI refinement)
- QA Engineer: 0.5 FTE
- Project Manager: 1.0 FTE

**Phase 3 (Advanced Features):**
- Developers: 4.0 FTE
- QA Engineer: 1.0 FTE (increased testing)
- Project Manager: 1.0 FTE

**Phase 4 (Testing & Launch):**
- QA Engineer: 1.0 FTE (lead role)
- Developers: 2.0 FTE (bug fixes, optimization)
- Project Manager: 1.0 FTE

### Resource Constraints:
- Single QA engineer may create bottleneck in testing phase
- Payment integration expertise limited to 1 senior developer
- Design team front-loaded, available for other projects after week 12

## 4. RISK BUFFERS & CONTINGENCY PLANNING

### Schedule Buffers:
- **Project Buffer:** 2 weeks at end (before holiday deadline)
- **Integration Buffer:** 1 week after payment gateway integration
- **Testing Buffer:** 1 week additional testing time built into schedule

### High-Risk Activities:
1. **Payment Gateway Integration (Weeks 13-15)**
   - Risk: API complexity, certification delays
   - Mitigation: Start technical research in week 8, have backup payment provider
   - Buffer: 3 days additional time allocated

2. **Third-Party API Integrations (Weeks 17-19)**
   - Risk: API limitations, data format mismatches
   - Mitigation: Create integration prototypes in week 12
   - Buffer: 2 days per integration

3. **Security Testing & SSL (Weeks 23-24)**
   - Risk: Security vulnerabilities, certificate delays
   - Mitigation: Security review in week 20, pre-order SSL certificates
   - Buffer: 3 days additional time

### Contingency Plans:
- **If payment integration delayed:** Use manual payment processing temporarily
- **If inventory integration fails:** Launch with manual inventory management
- **If deadline at risk:** Reduce non-essential features (wishlist, advanced admin)

## 5. MONITORING FRAMEWORK

### Weekly Progress Metrics:
- Sprint velocity (story points completed)
- Critical path schedule variance
- Budget burn rate vs. plan
- Defect discovery and resolution rates

### Milestone Reviews:
- **Week 4:** Architecture & design approval
- **Week 12:** Core features demo
- **Week 16:** Payment system validation
- **Week 20:** Integration completion
- **Week 24:** Beta testing results
- **Week 26:** Production launch

### Success Criteria:
- All 15 key features delivered
- Performance: <3 second page loads
- Security: Pass security audit
- Quality: <5% post-launch defect rate
- Launch: Ready for holiday season traffic
