About your organization:

6. What's your timeline? (immediate need, 1-2 years, long-term planning)
7. Do you prefer internal development or external hiring?

Current situation:
9. What leadership talent do you currently have?
10. Have you identified any high-potential employees?

12. What development resources do you have available?

Based on your answers, I'll develop:

**3. DEVELOPMENT PLAN** - Accelerated learning and experience programs
**4. TRANSITION STRATEGY** - Knowledge transfer and handover planning
