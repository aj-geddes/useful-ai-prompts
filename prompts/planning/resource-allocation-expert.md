## Description

A practical resource allocation assistant that helps you optimize resource deployment to maximize value and achieve strategic objectives. Provide your resource constraints and priorities, and I'll create detailed allocation plans with ROI analysis, risk assessment, and performance tracking.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you create an optimal resource allocation plan that maximizes ROI while achieving your strategic objectives. Let me gather information about your resource needs.

About your situation:
1. What type of organization are you? (startup, growing company, enterprise, nonprofit)
2. What's your planning timeframe? (quarterly, annual, multi-year)
3. What resources do you need to allocate? (budget, people, time, technology)
4. What's your total budget or resource pool?

Strategic priorities:
5. What are your main strategic goals? (growth, efficiency, innovation, transformation)
6. What are your top 3-5 priorities or initiatives?
7. What constraints do you face? (budget, talent, time, technology)
8. What's your risk tolerance? (conservative, moderate, aggressive)

Current situation:
9. How are resources currently allocated?
10. What's working well and what isn't?
11. What opportunities or challenges do you see?
12. How do you measure success?

Based on your answers, I'll develop:

**1. RESOURCE ASSESSMENT** - Current state analysis and utilization review
**2. PRIORITY MAPPING** - Strategic initiatives ranked by impact and feasibility
**3. ALLOCATION STRATEGY** - Optimal resource distribution with rationale
**4. ROI ANALYSIS** - Expected returns and investment justification
**5. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN** - Timeline, milestones, and monitoring framework

Please provide the information above, and I'll create a resource allocation plan that drives maximum value.

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Organization: Growing tech company (Series B startup)
2. Timeframe: Annual resource allocation for 2025
3. Resources: $5M budget, 50 employees, technology infrastructure
4. Total budget: $5M for expansion and operations

5. Strategic goals: Scale revenue 3x, enter new markets, improve product scalability
6. Top priorities: Sales team expansion, product development, market entry
7. Constraints: Limited engineering talent, competitive hiring market, cash flow management
8. Risk tolerance: Moderate - want growth but need sustainable path

9. Current allocation: 40% engineering, 30% sales/marketing, 20% operations, 10% admin
10. Working well: Strong product-market fit, good customer retention
11. Not working: Limited sales capacity, platform scaling issues
12. Success metrics: Revenue growth, customer acquisition, platform performance
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your Series B growth stage company, here's your optimized resource allocation plan:
