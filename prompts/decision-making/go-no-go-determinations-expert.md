#### Success Monitoring and Adjustment Framework

```python
class LaunchMonitoringSystem:
    def __init__(self, success_criteria, abort_triggers, adjustment_thresholds):
        self.criteria = success_criteria
        self.triggers = abort_triggers
        self.thresholds = adjustment_thresholds
        
    def monitor_launch_performance(self, time_period):
        """Real-time launch performance monitoring and alerting"""
        
        performance_metrics = {
            'customer_acquisition': self.track_customer_growth(),
            'platform_performance': self.monitor_technical_metrics(),
            'customer_satisfaction': self.measure_satisfaction_scores(),
            'financial_performance': self.track_revenue_metrics(),
            'competitive_dynamics': self.monitor_market_changes()
        }
        
        return self.evaluate_performance_status(performance_metrics)
    
    def evaluate_performance_status(self, metrics):
        """Determine if launch is on track or requires intervention"""
        
        status_indicators = {
            'green': all(m['status'] == 'on_track' for m in metrics.values()),
            'yellow': any(m['status'] == 'warning' for m in metrics.values()),
            'red': any(m['status'] == 'critical' for m in metrics.values())
        }
        
        if status_indicators['red']:
            return self.trigger_intervention_protocol(metrics)
        elif status_indicators['yellow']:
            return self.initiate_adjustment_procedures(metrics)
        else:
            return self.continue_planned_execution(metrics)

# Implement monitoring system
monitor = LaunchMonitoringSystem(
    success_criteria=defined_success_metrics,
    abort_triggers=critical_failure_conditions,
    adjustment_thresholds=performance_boundaries
)

launch_status = monitor.monitor_launch_performance('week_1')
```

## Usage Instructions
1. Begin with comprehensive readiness assessment across technical, market, and organizational dimensions
2. Establish clear success criteria with measurable thresholds and validation methods
3. Conduct probability analysis using statistical modeling and scenario planning
4. Apply multi-criteria decision framework with weighted scoring and risk adjustment
5. Develop go/no-go recommendation with clear rationale and confidence level
6. Create detailed implementation plan with conditions, timelines, and resource requirements
7. Design monitoring framework with success metrics and intervention triggers
8. Establish feedback loops for continuous improvement and future decision enhancement

## Examples
### Example 1: Market Entry Go/No-Go Decision
**Input**: 
```
{{decision_type}}: International market entry for established domestic business
{{stage_phase}}: Post-market research and pilot program completion
{{investment_scale}}: Significant with $5M entry investment and ongoing operational costs
{{risk_level}}: High due to cultural differences, regulatory requirements, and competitive landscape
{{success_dependencies}}: Local partnerships, regulatory approval, and customer acceptance
```

**Output**: [Market entry go/no-go analysis with cultural assessment, regulatory path validation, competitive positioning, and phased entry strategy]

### Example 2: Major IT System Migration Decision
**Input**:
```
{{decision_type}}: Enterprise system migration from legacy to cloud platform
{{stage_phase}}: Post-proof of concept and vendor selection
{{investment_scale}}: Transformational with $20M budget and 24-month timeline
{{reversibility}}: Extremely difficult with high switching costs and business disruption
{{stakeholder_commitment}}: Conditional with concerns about disruption and change management
```

**Output**: [System migration go/no-go evaluation with technical readiness, organizational capability, risk assessment, and phased migration approach]
