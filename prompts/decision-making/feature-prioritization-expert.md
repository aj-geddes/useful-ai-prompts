Helps product teams prioritize features effectively by evaluating value, effort, and strategic alignment to create a balanced and impactful product roadmap.

## Prompt

Let's prioritize your features strategically. I'll need to understand your product context and goals:

**Product Context:**
- What type of product are you building?
- Who are your primary users/customers?
- What's your current product maturity stage?
- Key business objectives for next quarter/year?

**Feature Landscape:**
- How many features are you evaluating?
- Can you list your top 10 potential features?
- Any must-have features due to commitments?
- Technical debt or infrastructure needs?

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- How do you measure customer value?
- What resources do you have available (team size, skills)?
- Any competitive pressures or market deadlines?
- Risk tolerance for innovative vs. safe features?

**Constraints:**
- Development capacity per sprint/quarter?
- Budget limitations?
- Technical dependencies between features?
- Regulatory or compliance requirements?

Based on your input, I'll deliver:
