## Description
Optimizes resource allocation decisions by analyzing capacity, demand, priorities, and constraints to maximize value and efficiency across competing needs.

## Prompt

I'll help you allocate your resources optimally across competing demands. Let's analyze your situation:

**Resource Overview:**
- What types of resources are you allocating? (people, budget, equipment, time)
- What's the total pool available?
- Any specialized skills or constraints?
- Time period for this allocation?

**Demand Analysis:**
- What projects/areas need resources?
- What are the minimum requirements for each?
- Any fixed commitments already made?
- Expected value/return from each area?

**Constraints & Dependencies:**
- Any resources that can't be split?
- Dependencies between projects?
- Regulatory or policy constraints?
- Geographic or timing limitations?

**Optimization Goals:**
- Maximize efficiency or effectiveness?
- Balance short-term vs long-term?
- Risk tolerance for resource shortage?
- Need for flexibility/buffer?

Based on your inputs, I'll develop:

## RESOURCE ALLOCATION STRATEGY

### Executive Summary
- Total resources: [Amount/count]
- Allocation across: [X projects/areas]
- Utilization rate → X%
- Value optimization: [Achieved/compromised]

### Current vs Proposed Allocation
| Area/Project | Current | Proposed | Change | Justification |
|--------------|---------|----------|---------|---------------|
| [Project A] | 25% | 35% | +10% | [High ROI, critical path] |
| [Project B] | 30% | 20% | -10% | [Lower priority] |
| [Project C] | 20% | 25% | +5% | [Strategic importance] |
| [Buffer/Flex] | 5% | 10% | +5% | [Risk mitigation] |

### Resource Mapping
**[Resource Type 1 - e.g., Senior Developers]**
- Total available: [X units]
- Allocation:
  - Project A: [X units] - [specific tasks]
  - Project B: [Y units] - [specific tasks]
  - Flex pool: [Z units] - [emergency/overflow]

### Value Analysis
| Allocation Scenario | Expected Value | Risk Level | Feasibility |
|--------------------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Proposed (Balanced) | $X / [Y points] | Medium | High |
| Alternative 1 (Aggressive) | $X / [Y points] | High | Medium |
| Alternative 2 (Conservative) | $X / [Y points] | Low | High |

### Critical Success Factors
✓ **Minimum Requirements Met:**
- [Project A]: [Requirement satisfied]
- [Project B]: [Requirement satisfied]

⚠️ **Stretch Goals at Risk:**
- [Project C]: [May need adjustment if...]

### Implementation Plan
**Week 1: Communication**
- Notify teams of allocation decisions
- Clarify expectations and deliverables

**Week 2: Transition**
- Shift resources according to plan
- Address any conflicts or gaps

**Ongoing: Monitoring**
- Weekly utilization reviews
- Monthly rebalancing sessions
- Quarterly strategic reassessment

### Contingency Planning
**If demand increases:**
1. Tap into flex pool first (10% buffer)
2. Negotiate scope reductions
3. Consider external resources

**If resources decrease:**
1. Priority-based cuts (lowest first)
2. Defer non-critical work
3. Combine related efforts

### Performance Metrics
- Resource utilization → Target 85-90%
- Project completion rates
- Value delivered per resource unit
- Team satisfaction scores

What resources do you need to allocate?

## Example

**Input**: 
"I have 12 developers for Q1. Three projects competing: customer portal (revenue generating), tech debt (stability), new feature (competitive advantage). Also need 20% time for maintenance."

**Output**: 
Recommends allocation of 4 devs to portal (35%), 3 to tech debt (25%), 3 to new feature (25%), 2 for maintenance (15%), with rotation schedule and skills-based assignments maximizing efficiency.
