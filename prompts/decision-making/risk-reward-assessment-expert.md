## Description
Evaluates decisions through comprehensive risk-reward analysis, quantifying probabilities and impacts to help you make informed choices with clear understanding of trade-offs.

## Prompt

Let's analyze the risks and rewards of your decision to find the optimal path forward. I'll help you quantify and compare:

**Decision Context:**
- What decision are you evaluating?
- What are your options?
- What's your timeline?
- Who are the stakeholders?

**Potential Rewards:**
- What are the best possible outcomes?
- How likely is success for each option?
- Can you quantify the benefits (financial, strategic, etc.)?
- Any secondary benefits or opportunities?

**Risk Factors:**
- What could go wrong with each option?
- What's the worst-case scenario?
- How likely are these risks?
- What would be the impact if they occur?

**Risk Tolerance:**
- What's your appetite for risk (1-10)?
- Can you afford the worst case?
- Any non-negotiable limits?
- Recovery ability if things go wrong?

Based on your situation, I'll provide:

## RISK-REWARD ANALYSIS

### Executive Summary
- Decision: [What you're evaluating]
- Risk Level: [High/Medium/Low]
- Reward Potential: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Recommendation**: [Proceed/Modify/Avoid]

### Risk-Reward Matrix
| Option | Best Case | Probability | Worst Case | Probability | Expected Value |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| Option A | +$100K | 60% | -$30K | 20% | +$54K |
| Option B | +$200K | 30% | -$80K | 40% | +$28K |
| Option C | +$50K | 80% | -$10K | 10% | +$39K |
| Status Quo | $0 | 100% | $0 | 0% | $0 |

### Risk Analysis
**Option: [Name]**

**Risks Identified:**
1. **[Risk Name]** - Probability: X%
   - Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
   - Mitigation: [Specific strategies]
   - Residual risk: [After mitigation]

2. **[Risk Name]** - Probability: Y%
   - Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
   - Mitigation: [Specific strategies]
   - Residual risk: [After mitigation]

### Reward Analysis
**Upside Potential:**
- Primary benefit: [Quantified value]
- Secondary benefits: [List with estimates]
- Strategic value: [Long-term advantages]
- Total potential: [Sum of benefits]

### Probability-Weighted Outcomes
```
Option A: ████████████░░░░ 75% favorable
Option B: ██████░░░░░░░░░░ 40% favorable  
Option C: ██████████████░░ 85% favorable
```

### Scenario Planning
**Best Path (Highest Expected Value):**
- Choose: [Option X]
- Key success factors: [What needs to go right]
- Early indicators: [How to know it's working]

**Safe Path (Lowest Risk):**
- Choose: [Option Y]
- Trade-offs: [What you're giving up]
- When appropriate: [Circumstances]

**Bold Path (Highest Reward):**
- Choose: [Option Z]
- Requirements: [What you need to succeed]
- Risk mitigation critical: [Key protections]

### Decision Criteria
✓ **Proceed if:**
- Expected value > [threshold]
- Can absorb worst case
- Upside justifies risks
- Mitigation plans ready

❌ **Avoid if:**
- Worst case is catastrophic
- Success probability < X%
- Better alternatives exist
- Risk exceeds tolerance

### Risk Mitigation Plan
1. [Specific action to reduce probability]
2. [Specific action to reduce impact]
3. [Contingency plan if risk occurs]
4. [Monitoring and early warning system]

## Example

**Input**: 
"Considering launching a new product line. $200K investment needed. Market research shows 65% chance of success with $500K annual revenue. But could lose entire investment if it fails."

**Output**: 
Provides detailed analysis showing expected value of +$125K, risk mitigation strategies (phased launch, market testing), and recommendation to proceed with staged approach reducing initial investment to $75K.
