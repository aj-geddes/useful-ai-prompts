## Example Usage

### Input
"We're a sustainable coffee company that sources directly from small farms in Colombia. Our mission is to pay farmers fairly while reducing environmental impact. Target audience is eco-conscious millennials who care about ethical consumption."

### Output

## BRAND POSITIONING ANALYSIS

### Competitive Landscape
Most specialty coffee brands compete on taste, origin, or convenience. Few own the emotional territory of **genuine farmer partnership** with verifiable impact. Your differentiation opportunity lies not in claiming sustainability, but in making the farmer relationship tangible and personal.

### Emotional Territory
**Core emotion:** Connection across worlds
**Supporting emotions:** Pride in ethical choices, hope for positive change, belonging to conscious community

### Unique Position
"The coffee that introduces you to the family who grew it."

## CORE NARRATIVE THEME

### Central Story: "Every Cup Connects Worlds"

Your brand story bridges the gap between conscious consumers and the farming families whose livelihoods depend on ethical trade. The emotional arc follows transformation: from anonymous commodity to meaningful connection.

This theme works because:
- It's specific to your model (not claimable by competitors)
- It creates emotional investment in purchase decisions
- It provides endless authentic content opportunities
- It positions customers as heroes in a larger story

## PRIMARY BRAND STORY

### Origin Narrative Framework

**The Hook:**
"We started with a question: What if every coffee drinker could meet the family who grew their beans?"

**The Journey:**
"That question led us to Colombia, to Maria's farm, where three generations have cultivated coffee on volcanic slopes. When we asked what would help most, she didn't say 'more money' first - she said 'respect for our craft.'

So we built something different. Not a transaction, but a relationship. Every bag traces to a specific farm. Every purchase sends 3x the fair trade minimum. And every customer can see exactly where their morning ritual began."

**The Transformation:**
"Now, when you brew your morning coffee, you're not just consuming a product. You're completing a connection that started 4,000 miles away, on a mountainside, with hands that have perfected this craft for generations."

**The Invitation:**
"This is coffee that closes the distance. Will you be part of the connection?"
