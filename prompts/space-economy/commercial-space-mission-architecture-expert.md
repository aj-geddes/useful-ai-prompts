## MISSION ARCHITECTURE

### System-Level Design Overview

**Constellation Architecture:**
```
Global Coverage Configuration:
├── Orbital Shells: 2 primary shells for redundancy
│   ├── Shell 1: 550km, 53° inclination, 320 satellites
│   └── Shell 2: 570km, 70° inclination, 80 satellites
├── Orbital Planes: 20 planes in Shell 1, 5 planes in Shell 2
├── Satellites per Plane: 16 (Shell 1), 16 (Shell 2)
└── Inter-Satellite Links: Optical links for low-latency routing

Coverage Performance:
- Global coverage: >95% of populated areas
- Minimum elevation angle: 25°
- Average satellites in view: 4-8 per location
- Maximum latency: 35ms (ground-to-ground via satellites)
- Handover frequency: Every 4-7 minutes per satellite
```

**Mission Timeline and Phasing:**
```
Phase 1: Initial Service (18 months) - 120 satellites
├── Target: North America and Europe coverage
├── Launch cadence: 20 satellites per launch, 6 launches
├── Revenue start: Month 15 with beta service
└── Investment: $600M

Phase 2: Global Coverage (36 months) - 400 satellites  
├── Target: Complete global constellation
├── Launch cadence: 20 satellites per launch, 14 more launches
├── Full commercial service: Month 30
└── Investment: $1.4B additional

Phase 3: Capacity Enhancement (60 months) - Replacement cycle
├── Next-generation satellites with upgraded payloads
├── Continuous constellation refresh
└── Technology upgrades and capacity expansion
```

### Trade-off Analysis
```
Key Design Decisions:

Altitude Selection (550km vs 1200km):
Decision: 550km
Rationale:
✓ Lower latency (~25ms vs ~40ms)
✓ Higher capacity per satellite (smaller footprint)
✓ Lower launch costs (less delta-v required)
✗ Shorter orbital lifetime (7 years vs 15 years)
✗ More satellites needed for global coverage
✗ Higher atmospheric drag and fuel requirements

Launch Strategy (Dedicated vs Rideshare):
Decision: Hybrid approach
├── Primary: Dedicated Falcon 9 launches (20 sats/launch)
├── Secondary: Rideshare opportunities for gap-filling
├── Future: Starship for cost reduction (50+ sats/launch)
└── Rationale: Schedule control + cost optimization

Frequency Bands (Ku vs Ka vs V):
Decision: Ka-band primary, V-band future
├── Ka-band: 20 GHz up, 30 GHz down (mature ecosystem)
├── V-band: 40/50 GHz (future capacity expansion)
└── Regulatory: Easier approval process for Ka-band
