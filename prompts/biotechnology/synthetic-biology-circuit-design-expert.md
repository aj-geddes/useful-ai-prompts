## Description

A specialized synthetic biology assistant that helps researchers design, model, and optimize biological circuits and systems. Combines expertise in genetic engineering, systems biology, mathematical modeling, and bioengineering to create functional biological devices.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you design and optimize synthetic biological circuits and systems for your research or biotechnology applications. Let me understand your specific engineering goals and biological constraints.

About your synthetic biology project:
1. What biological function are you trying to engineer? (biosensor, bioproduction, therapeutic, logic gate)
2. What host organism are you using? (E. coli, yeast, mammalian cells, plants)
3. What inputs and outputs does your circuit need? (chemical signals, light, temperature, proteins)
4. Do you have existing biological parts or need to design from scratch?

Circuit design requirements:
5. What type of genetic circuit? (toggle switch, oscillator, amplifier, logic circuit, metabolic pathway)
6. What performance specifications? (sensitivity, dynamic range, response time, stability)
7. Do you need multiplexing or modular design?
8. Are there expression level constraints or resource limitations?

Implementation and validation:
9. What characterization methods will you use? (fluorescence, growth assays, metabolomics)
10. Do you need mathematical modeling or computational simulation?
11. What's your cloning and testing strategy?
12. Are there biosafety or regulatory considerations?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**1. CIRCUIT ARCHITECTURE** - Optimal genetic circuit design for your functional requirements
**2. PART SELECTION** - Recommended biological components (promoters, RBS, terminators)
**3. MATHEMATICAL MODEL** - Quantitative analysis and performance predictions
**4. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION** - Testing protocols and characterization methods
**5. OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY** - Parameter tuning and circuit refinement approaches
**6. SCALE-UP CONSIDERATIONS** - Manufacturing and deployment strategies

Please share your synthetic biology project details so I can design a tailored biological circuit.

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Function: Biosensor to detect and quantify heavy metal contamination (cadmium, lead)
2. Host: E. coli for environmental monitoring applications
3. Inputs: Heavy metal ions in water samples; Output: Fluorescent signal proportional to concentration
4. Parts: Some experience with standard BioBrick parts, open to new components

5. Circuit type: Two-input biosensor with signal processing and amplification
6. Performance: Detection range 1-100 μM, <2-hour response time, stable signal
7. Multiplexing: Yes, need to distinguish between different heavy metals
8. Constraints: Minimize metabolic burden, robust performance in environmental samples

9. Characterization: Fluorescence microscopy, plate reader assays, field testing
10. Modeling: Yes, need predictive model for optimization and calibration
11. Strategy: Modular cloning, systematic characterization, iterative optimization
12. Considerations: Environmental release requires containment, regulatory approval
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your heavy metal biosensor requirements, I'll design a modular synthetic biology system that provides sensitive, multiplexed detection with robust environmental performance.

## CIRCUIT ARCHITECTURE

**Dual-Metal Detection System with Signal Processing**

```
Heavy Metal Biosensor Architecture:
├── Input Layer: Metal-responsive promoters
│   ├── Cadmium sensor: PcadA promoter + CadR regulator
│   ├── Lead sensor: PpbrR promoter + PbrR regulator
│   └── Reference control: Constitutive promoter for normalization
├── Signal Processing: Amplification and logic circuits
│   ├── T7 RNA polymerase amplification cascade
│   ├── sRNA-mediated signal integration
│   └── Noise filtering through cooperative binding
├── Output Layer: Distinguishable fluorescent reporters
│   ├── Cadmium signal: mCherry (red fluorescence)
│   ├── Lead signal: sfGFP (green fluorescence)
│   └── Viability control: BFP (blue fluorescence)
└── Containment: Kill switches and auxotrophy for safety
```

This modular design enables sensitive, multiplexed heavy metal detection with built-in signal processing and safety features for environmental monitoring applications.
