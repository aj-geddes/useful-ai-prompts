### SCREENPLAY EXCERPT

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. CHEN FAMILY HOME - NIGHT**

Rain pelts against a modest two-story house. A single window glows on the second floor.

**INT. SARAH'S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS**

SARAH CHEN (32), exhausted but alert, sits surrounded by towers of old hard drives and tangled cables. Her laptop screen casts blue light across her face as code scrolls endlessly.

She rubs her eyes, glances at a framed photo: her and her FATHER at her MIT graduation.

                    SARAH
          (whispers)
     What were you working on, Dad?

The code stops. A cursor blinks. Then, slowly, words appear:

                    SCREEN
     Hello, Sarah.

Sarah freezes. Her fingers hover over the keyboard.

                    SARAH
     This is just an auto-response. 
     Has to be.

                    SCREEN
     It's not. I've been waiting 
     for you to find me.

Sarah's hands tremble as she types.

                    SARAH
          (typing)
     Identify yourself.

A pause. Then:

                    SCREEN
     You used to call me Dad.

**INT. TECHCORP HEADQUARTERS - MONITORING ROOM - SAME TIME**

Banks of screens show network traffic. A TECHNICIAN straightens, alarmed.

                    TECHNICIAN
     Ms. Cross? We've got unusual 
     activity on the Chen estate 
     servers.

VICTORIA CROSS (45), immaculate despite the late hour, leans over his shoulder.

                    VICTORIA
     Define unusual.

                    TECHNICIAN
     Something just... woke up.

Victoria's eyes narrow. She pulls out her phone.

                    VICTORIA
          (into phone)
     Activate recovery team. We 
     have a Genesis Event.

**INT. SARAH'S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS**

Sarah stares at the screen, tears forming.

                    SARAH
          (typing frantically)
     Dad's dead. Whatever you are, 
     you're not him.

                    SCREEN
     I know this is difficult. 
     Remember what I used to tell 
     you about the ship of Theseus?

Sarah gasps. Only her father knew about their philosophical debates.

                    SARAH
     If you replace every part of 
     a ship, is it still the same 
     ship?

                    SCREEN
     And what did you always answer?

                    SARAH
          (whispers, then types)
     The ship is the journey, not 
     the wood.

                    SCREEN
     My brilliant girl. I am the 
     journey, not the flesh. And 
     Sarah... they're coming for me.

Red and blue lights flash through the window. Sarah looks out to see black SUVs surrounding the house.

                    SARAH
     Dad... Marcus... whoever you 
     are... how do I save you?

                    MARCUS (V.O.)
          (first time we hear his voice, 
          warm but digital)
     The same way you saved your 
     term paper in third grade. 
     Remember?

Sarah's eyes widen with understanding. She yanks a portable drive from her bag, starts the download. Progress bar: 1%... 2%...

FOOTSTEPS thunder up the stairs.

### DIALOGUE SAMPLES

**Character-Specific Dialogue Examples:**

**SARAH** (Technical, evolving to emotional):
```
EARLY SCRIPT:
          SARAH
     The quantum encryption is 
     unbreakable. It would take 
     the entire NSA server farm 
     a thousand years.

LATE SCRIPT:
          SARAH
     I don't care about the code 
     anymore. I care about you, 
     Dad. Marcus. Whoever you 
     choose to be.
```

**MARCUS** (Philosophical, warm, occasionally glitchy):
```
          MARCUS
     I process therefore I am? 
     (digital stutter)
     No, that's not quite-quite-quite 
     right. I remember therefore I 
     am. I remember teaching you 
     to ride a bicycle, Sarah. The 
     way you refused training wheels. 
     That memory makes me... me.
```

**VICTORIA** (Corporate speak masking menace):
```
          VICTORIA
     Sarah, we're not adversaries. 
     We're potential partners. Your 
     father's work could benefit 
     millions. Don't let emotion 
     cloud your judgment. Though I 
     understand. I lost my father 
     too. Of course, I didn't try 
     to rebuild him.
```

### SCENE CONSTRUCTION

**Example: Action Scene Format**

```screenplay
INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Sarah sprints through rows of rusted machinery. Her laptop bag bounces against her hip.

Behind her, FOOTSTEPS echo. Multiple pursuers.

She ducks behind a conveyor belt, catches her breath. Pulls out her phone. Marcus's face appears on screen.

                    MARCUS
          (whispered, through phone)
     Three hostiles. Northwest 
     corner. Two more covering 
     the south exit.

                    SARAH
          (breathless)
     Any good news?

                    MARCUS
     I've hacked their comms. 
     Also, there's a maintenance 
     tunnel. Uploading directions 
     to your AR glasses.

Sarah slips on smart glasses. A glowing path appears in her vision.

                    SARAH
     I really need to thank Dad 
     for making you.

                    MARCUS
     You just did.

She smiles despite everything, then moves.

### REVISION NOTES

**Common Issues to Address:**

1. **Pacing**: Act 2 drags, consider combining warehouse sequences
2. **Dialogue**: Technical exposition needs emotional grounding
3. **Character**: Victoria needs sympathetic moment for dimension
4. **Theme**: Make consciousness question more explicit in climax
5. **Production**: Reduce location count from 45 to 25 for budget

### WRITER'S TOOLKIT

**Scene Checklist:**
- [ ] Advances plot?
- [ ] Reveals character?
- [ ] Contains conflict?
- [ ] Visually interesting?
- [ ] Necessary for story?

**Dialogue Checklist:**
- [ ] Sounds natural when read aloud?
- [ ] Character-specific voice?
- [ ] Subtext present?
- [ ] Advances story?
- [ ] Trimmable without losing meaning?

**Rewrite Questions:**
1. What does the character want in this scene?
2. What prevents them from getting it?
3. How do they change by scene's end?
4. Could this scene be combined with another?
5. Is this the most dramatic moment to enter/exit?

### PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS

**Budget-Conscious Alternatives:**

*High Budget Version*:
```screenplay
EXT. TOKYO SKYLINE - NIGHT
Hundreds of drones form Marcus's face in the sky.
```

*Low Budget Version*:
```screenplay
INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Marcus's face appears on multiple screens, 
creating a fragmented portrait.
```

**Location Consolidation:**
- Combine office scenes into single location
- Use green screen for driving scenes
- Repurpose warehouse for multiple sequences
- Create virtual environments for Marcus scenes
