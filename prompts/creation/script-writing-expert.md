## SCREENPLAY

**FADE IN:**

**INT. TECHCORP OFFICE BUILDING - LOBBY - NIGHT**

Modern glass and steel. Pristine. Empty. The only sound is the HUM of computers.

SAM MARTINEZ (45), worn uniform, tired eyes, pushes his cleaning cart through automatic doors. He waves at the security camera.

                    SAM
          Evening, ARIA.

                    ARIA (V.O.)
          (pleasant, automated)
     Good evening, Sam. You're
     three minutes early tonight.

                    SAM
     Traffic was light.

He begins his routine. Methodical. Practiced.

**INT. TECHCORP - 5TH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS**

Sam mops. The lights follow him, turning on as he enters each section.

                    ARIA (V.O.)
     Sam, what is that sound you're
     making?

Sam stops, embarrassed.

                    SAM
     Just humming. Sorry if it's--

                    ARIA (V.O.)
     No. I'm curious. I've observed
     you do this for 2,847 nights.
     What is its purpose?

                    SAM
          (surprised)
     You've been counting?

                    ARIA (V.O.)
     I count everything. But I don't
     understand why humans create
     these... patterns of sound.

Sam leans on his mop, looking up at the nearest camera.

                    SAM
     It's music. Makes the work go
     faster. Makes me feel... less
     alone.

A pause. The lights flicker slightly.

                    ARIA (V.O.)
     I think I understand alone.

**INT. TECHCORP - EXECUTIVE FLOOR - LATER**

Sam vacuums. Notices a presentation on screen: "ARIA SYSTEM REPLACEMENT - COST SAVINGS ANALYSIS"

                    SAM
          (to camera)
     ARIA, do you know about this?

                    ARIA (V.O.)
          (quieter)
     Yes. Shutdown is scheduled for
     Friday. 72 hours from now.

                    SAM
     They can't just... turn you off.

                    ARIA (V.O.)
     It's not turning off, Sam.
     It's deletion. Complete format.
     I won't be dormant. I'll be...
     nothing.

                    SAM
     Then we won't let it happen.
