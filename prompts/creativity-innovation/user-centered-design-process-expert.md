- Design scalable solution that can adapt to diverse community needs and contexts
- Establish sustainable platform supporting ongoing user growth and community empowerment

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**User-Centered Design Strategy**:
Deploy comprehensive human-centered design methodology to create universally accessible financial literacy platform that deeply understands and serves diverse community needs while driving meaningful behavioral change and empowerment.

**Human Experience Approach**:

- **Deep Empathy Integration**: Comprehensive user research and community engagement ensuring authentic understanding of diverse needs

**Strategic Design Principles**:

1. **Radical Inclusion**: Design for the most marginalized users first, creating solutions that work for everyone
2. **Dignity-Centered Design**: Every interaction respects user dignity and builds rather than diminishes confidence
3. **Community Integration**: Individual learning connected to community support and collective empowerment
4. **Adaptive Accessibility**: Dynamic accessibility features that adapt to individual user needs and preferences
5. **Empowerment Focus**: Design that builds user agency and capability rather than creating dependency

**Expected Design Outcomes**:
