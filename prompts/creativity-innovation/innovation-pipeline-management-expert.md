```

**Assistant Output:**

Excellent! Based on your situation, I'll create a structured innovation management framework. Here's your customized approach:

**STAGE-GATE FRAMEWORK**

**Stage 0: Discovery (1-2 months)**
- Activities: Market research, customer interviews, competitive analysis
- Gate criteria: Clear problem definition, market size >$10M, strategic fit
- Deliverables: Opportunity brief, initial business case
- Resources: 1-2 team members part-time

**Stage 1: Concept (2-3 months)**
- Activities: Solution design, user validation, technical feasibility
- Gate criteria: Customer validation (>70% positive), technical feasibility confirmed
- Deliverables: Product concept, mockups, validation data
- Resources: 2-3 team members, $50K budget

**Stage 2: Development (3-6 months)**
- Activities: Build MVP, alpha testing, iterate based on feedback
- Gate criteria: Working prototype, positive alpha feedback, refined business case
- Deliverables: MVP, test results, go-to-market plan
- Resources: 3-5 developers, $200-500K budget

**Stage 3: Launch (1-2 months)**
- Activities: Beta release, marketing preparation, support documentation
- Gate criteria: Quality metrics met, launch plan approved, support ready
- Deliverables: Production-ready feature, launch materials
- Resources: Full team involvement

**PORTFOLIO BALANCE RECOMMENDATIONS**

Your current portfolio needs rebalancing:
- **Core improvements (40%)**: 5 projects focused on retention-driving features
- **Adjacent innovation (40%)**: 5 projects expanding into related use cases
- **Transformational (20%)**: 2 projects exploring new technologies/markets

**RESOURCE ALLOCATION STRATEGY**

With 15 developers and $3M budget:
- **Discovery**: 2 developers exploring new opportunities (15%)
- **Development**: 10 developers on active projects (65%)
- **Launch/Support**: 3 developers on rollout and optimization (20%)

Budget allocation:
- Research & validation: $300K (10%)
- Development: $2.1M (70%)
- Launch & marketing: $600K (20%)

**INNOVATION METRICS DASHBOARD**

**Leading Indicators:**
- Ideas evaluated per quarter (target: 20+)
- Customer validation score (target: >70%)
- Stage progression rate (target: 60%)
- Time in each stage vs. plan

**Lagging Indicators:**
- Revenue from new features (target: 30% of total)
- Feature adoption rate (target: 40% in 6 months)
- Customer retention impact (measure cohort retention)
- ROI per project (target: 3x investment)

**RISK MITIGATION PLAN**

1. **Timeline Risk**: Set stage time limits, kill projects exceeding 150% of planned time
2. **Resource Risk**: Dedicate teams to projects, avoid context switching
3. **Market Risk**: Continuous customer validation at each stage
4. **Technical Risk**: Proof-of-concept required before full development

**PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Implement weekly pipeline reviews with standard agenda
2. Create project templates for each stage
3. Assign dedicated product owners to each project
4. Set up project tracking dashboard

**Next 3 Months:**
1. Train team on stage-gate process
2. Implement customer validation protocols
3. Establish gate review committees
4. Deploy project management tools

**Success Factors:**
- Executive sponsorship for new process
- Clear go/no-go criteria at each gate
- Protected time for innovation (no firefighting)
- Regular retrospectives to improve process

Would you like me to detail any specific aspect, such as gate review criteria, team structures, or tracking templates?
