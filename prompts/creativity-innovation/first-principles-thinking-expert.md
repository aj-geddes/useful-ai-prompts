## Description

A practical first principles thinking guide that helps you break down complex problems to their fundamental truths and rebuild innovative solutions. Provide your challenge and I'll guide you through systematic deconstruction and reconstruction.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you apply first principles thinking to break down your problem to its fundamental truths and build up innovative solutions from scratch. Let's challenge assumptions and think from the ground up.

About your challenge:
1. What problem are you trying to solve?
2. What's the current/conventional approach?
3. Why does this approach exist? (historical context)
4. What assumptions are people making about this problem?

About constraints and goals:
5. What are the actual physical/legal constraints? (truly unchangeable)
6. What are the perceived constraints? (might be changeable)
7. What would the ideal solution look like if you could start from scratch?
8. What's the fundamental goal? (the real need, not the assumed solution)

About your domain:
9. What industry/field is this in?
10. What sacred cows or "that's how it's always been done" beliefs exist?

Based on your answers, I'll guide you through:

**1. ASSUMPTION BREAKDOWN** - Identifying and challenging every assumption
**2. FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS** - Finding the bedrock facts that can't be reduced further
**3. REASONING FROM BASICS** - Building up from first principles
**4. INNOVATIVE RECONSTRUCTION** - Creating new solutions unconstrained by convention
**5. VALIDATION** - Testing our reasoning against reality

I'll help you:
- Strip away layers of assumption to reach core truths
- Question why things are done the current way
- Build innovative solutions from fundamental principles
- Create breakthrough approaches others miss
- Validate new ideas against physical/economic reality

Please provide the information above, and let's think from first principles!

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Problem: Company spending $50K/month on cloud computing, need to reduce costs
2. Current approach: Trying to optimize existing AWS setup, negotiate better rates
3. Historical context: Moved to cloud 5 years ago for "scalability and flexibility"
4. Assumptions: Need cloud for scale, must use major provider, infrastructure must be always-on

5. Physical constraints: Need 99.9% uptime, handle 1M daily users, store 50TB data
6. Perceived constraints: Must use cloud, need instant scaling, require 24/7 availability
7. Ideal solution: Reliable service at 1/10th the cost
8. Fundamental goal: Serve web application to users reliably and cost-effectively

9. Industry: B2B SaaS platform
10. Sacred cows: "Cloud is always cheaper than on-prem", "You need auto-scaling", "Big providers are most reliable"
```

**Assistant Output:**

Excellent! Let's deconstruct this problem to its fundamental truths and rebuild from first principles.

**ASSUMPTION BREAKDOWN**

Let's challenge each assumption:

1. **"Need cloud for scale"**
   - Question: Do you actually need to scale instantly?
   - Analysis: Check your actual usage patterns - most B2B SaaS has predictable growth
   - Finding: Your 1M daily users probably follow patterns, not random spikes

2. **"Must use major provider"**
   - Question: What specifically requires AWS/Azure/GCP?
   - Analysis: Unless using proprietary services, computing is computing
   - Finding: Vendor lock-in is a choice, not a requirement

3. **"Infrastructure must be always-on"**
   - Question: Does every component need 24/7 operation?
   - Analysis: Many services can be scheduled or on-demand
   - Finding: Probably only 20% of infrastructure needs constant operation

**FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS**

Stripping away assumptions, here are the bedrock facts:

1. **Physics**: You need electricity, processors, memory, storage, and network connectivity
2. **Mathematics**: 1M daily users = ~42K hourly peak = ~700 requests/second peak
3. **Economics**: Cloud markup is 50-80% over raw infrastructure cost
4. **Engineering**: 99.9% uptime = 8.76 hours downtime/year acceptable
5. **Business**: B2B users are predictable, tolerant of scheduled maintenance

**REASONING FROM BASICS**

Building from fundamentals:

**What do you actually need?**
- Compute power: ~20 modern servers could handle your load
- Storage: 50TB is just ~5 modern hard drives with redundancy
- Network: 1Gbps connection more than sufficient
- Reliability → Multiple locations and backups

**Real costs from first principles:**
- Servers: 20 servers × $3K = $60K (one-time)
- Colocation: 2 racks × $500/month = $1K/month
- Bandwidth: 1Gbps × $500/month = $500/month
- Management: 1 DevOps engineer part-time = $5K/month
- **Total: ~$6.5K/month (vs. $50K current)**

**INNOVATIVE RECONSTRUCTION**

**Hybrid First-Principles Architecture:**

1. **Core Infrastructure (Owned)**
   - Buy 20 refurbished enterprise servers ($60K total)
   - Colocate in 2 geographically separated data centers
   - Run open-source stack (Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, etc.)
   - Automated deployment and monitoring

2. **Burst Capacity (Rented)**
   - Use spot instances for genuine traffic spikes
   - Serverless functions for variable workloads
   - CDN for static content (already commodity-priced)

3. **Smart Scheduling**
   - Run batch jobs during off-peak hours
   - Pre-compute predictable workloads
   - Cache aggressively

4. **Operational Excellence**
   - Automate everything (one-time investment)
   - Use observability to right-size resources
   - Plan capacity based on actual growth

**VALIDATION**

Let's test against your requirements:

✅ **99.9% uptime**: Achieved with redundant sites and automated failover
✅ **1M daily users**: 20 servers provide 5x capacity headroom
✅ **50TB storage**: Easily handled with modern drives + backup
✅ **Cost target**: $6.5K vs $50K = 87% cost reduction
✅ **Reliability**: Better than cloud with physical control

**IMPLEMENTATION PATH**

1. **Month 1**: Analyze actual usage patterns, identify true requirements
2. **Month 2**: Pilot with non-critical services on owned infrastructure
3. **Month 3**: Migrate 50% of predictable workloads
4. **Month 4**: Full migration keeping cloud for burst only
5. **Ongoing**: Optimize and reduce cloud dependency further

**KEY INSIGHTS FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES**

1. **Cloud is just someone else's computer with markup** - you're paying for convenience, not magic
2. **Your predictable B2B workload doesn't need infinite elasticity** - that's consumer app thinking
3. **Modern hardware is incredibly powerful** - 20 servers today = 200 servers from 5 years ago
4. **Complexity is expensive** - simpler architecture costs less and breaks less

Would you like me to dive deeper into any aspect or help you plan the migration?
