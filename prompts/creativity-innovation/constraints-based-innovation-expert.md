## Description

A practical constraints-based innovation guide that helps you turn limitations into creative advantages. Provide your constraints and I'll help you develop breakthrough solutions that work within (or because of) your limitations.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you turn your constraints into creative catalysts for innovation. Often, the best solutions come from working within tight limitations. Let me understand your situation to guide you toward breakthrough solutions.

About your constraints:
1. What are your main limitations? (budget, time, resources, regulations, etc.)
2. How severe are these constraints? (slight inconvenience vs. seemingly impossible)
3. What specific numbers/limits are you dealing with? (e.g., $5000 budget, 2 weeks, 3 people)
4. Which constraints are absolutely fixed vs. potentially flexible?

About your challenge:
5. What are you trying to achieve despite these constraints?
6. Who will benefit from your solution?
7. What have others done in similar situations?
8. What would "good enough" look like? What would "amazing" look like?

About your resources:
9. What DO you have available? (skills, connections, assets, time)
10. What creative workarounds have you considered?

Based on your answers, I'll help you:

**1. REFRAME CONSTRAINTS** - Turn limitations into design specifications
**2. FIND HIDDEN ASSETS** - Discover resources you didn't know you had
**3. MULTIPLY RESOURCES** - Get more from less through creative leverage
**4. DESIGN FOR CONSTRAINTS** - Create solutions that thrive within limits
**5. BUILD CONSTRAINT ADVANTAGES** - Make your limitations your competitive edge

I'll provide:
- Specific strategies for your constraint type
- Examples from others who succeeded with similar limits
- Creative resource multiplication techniques
- Step-by-step implementation plan
- Ways to turn constraints into unique value

Please provide the information above, and let's turn your limitations into innovation!

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Main limitations: $500 budget to create employee wellness program for 50 people
2. Severity: Extreme - typical programs cost $50-100 per employee ($2500-5000)
3. Specifics: $500 total, must launch in 3 weeks, no dedicated staff time
4. Fixed constraints: Budget is absolute, timeline fixed, must be self-running

5. Goal: Improve employee wellbeing and reduce stress-related absences
6. Beneficiaries: 50 office employees, mostly sedentary, high stress
7. Others: Most companies hire wellness consultants or buy expensive apps
8. Good enough: Some participation and positive feedback. Amazing: 80% participation, measurable health improvements

9. Available resources: Break room, company Slack, enthusiastic employees, local park nearby
10. Workarounds: Thought about volunteer-led activities but worried about sustainability
```

**Assistant Output:**

Perfect! Your extreme budget constraint is actually an opportunity to create something more authentic and sustainable than expensive corporate wellness programs. Let's innovate.

**CONSTRAINT REFRAMING**

Your limitations become your design principles:
- **$10/person budget** → Focus on peer-led, community-driven wellness
- **No dedicated staff** → Must be employee-owned and self-sustaining  
- **3-week timeline** → Start simple, build momentum
- **Self-running requirement** → Design for intrinsic motivation, not external management

**HIDDEN ASSETS DISCOVERED**

You have more than you think:
1. **50 potential wellness leaders** (your employees)
2. **Existing social connections** (leverage workplace relationships)
3. **Daily touchpoints** (break room, Slack, lunch times)
4. **Intrinsic motivation** (people want to feel better)
5. **Free local resources** (park, YouTube, community spaces)

**RESOURCE MULTIPLICATION STRATEGY**

**1. Peer Wellness Champions ($0)**
- Recruit 5 volunteers passionate about different aspects (fitness, nutrition, mindfulness, sleep, social)
- Each champion leads one simple weekly activity
- Recognition, not payment: "Wellness Champion" title, flex time, parking spot

**2. Wellness Exchange Platform ($0)**
- Create Slack channel: #wellness-exchange
- Employees trade skills: "I'll teach yoga for Excel tips"
- Builds community while sharing wellness practices
- Self-sustaining through reciprocity

**3. Micro-Challenge System ($200)**
- Weekly 5-minute challenges (desk stretches, water intake, gratitude)
- $40/week in small prizes (coffee cards, extra break time)
- Challenges designed by employees, voted by community
- Gamification without expensive apps

**4. Lunch Walk & Talk Groups ($0)**
- Map three 15-minute routes around office/park
- Different themes: Power Walk, Nature Stroll, Social Saunter
- Self-organizing via Slack polls
- Combines movement, nature, and social connection

**5. Wellness Resource Library ($300)**
- Curated free resources: YouTube channels, apps, podcasts
- Print materials for common areas
- "Wellness Tip of the Day" rotation
- Employee book/resource exchange

**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

**Week 1: Foundation**
- Send survey: "What would make you feel healthier at work?" (discover intrinsic motivators)
- Recruit Wellness Champions from early enthusiasts
- Set up Slack channel and basic structure
- Create simple tracking system (weekly check-ins)

**Week 2: Launch**
- Monday: Announce program with emphasis on peer-led approach
- Introduce first micro-challenge (5-minute desk stretch)
- Champions announce their weekly offerings
- Start lunch walk groups

**Week 3: Momentum**
- Celebrate early wins publicly
- Launch Wellness Exchange
- Introduce peer recognition system
- Plan Month 2 based on participation data

**CONSTRAINT ADVANTAGES**

Your limitations create unique value:

1. **Authenticity**: Employee-led feels genuine vs. corporate mandated
2. **Sustainability**: No budget dependency means it can run forever
3. **Engagement**: People more committed to what they help create
4. **Flexibility**: Can adapt quickly based on what works
5. **Community**: Builds stronger team bonds than individual app usage

**SUCCESS AMPLIFIERS**

- **Make it visible**: Wellness board in break room with photos/updates
- **Celebrate small wins**: "John walked 5 days straight!"
- **Cross-pollinate**: Accounting teaches meditation, IT leads bike group
- **Evolution built-in**: Monthly "What's working?" discussions

**MEASURING SUCCESS**

Track without expensive tools:
- Weekly participation numbers (simple spreadsheet)
- Slack channel engagement
- Voluntary testimonials
- Sick day trends
- Pulse survey at 30/60/90 days

This constraint-based approach could actually outperform expensive programs because it's built on intrinsic motivation and peer support rather than external incentives.
