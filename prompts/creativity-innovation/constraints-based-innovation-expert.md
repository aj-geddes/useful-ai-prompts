• Responsibility Distribution: Community members take ownership of different system components and maintenance

Technology Stewardship Program:
• Community Tech Stewards: 20 trained community members providing peer support and basic maintenance
• Mentorship Networks: Retired professionals mentoring community members in technology use and health management
• Peer Learning Circles: Regular community gatherings for technology training and health education
• Youth Engagement: High school students earning service learning credits through technology support

Economic Sustainability Framework:
• Health Cost Savings: Reduced emergency healthcare costs funding ongoing technology investment
• Cooperative Revenue: Small fees for technology services to neighboring communities
• Grant and Donation Management: Community-managed fund development and stewardship
• Economic Impact Measurement: Tracking economic benefits and community wealth creation
