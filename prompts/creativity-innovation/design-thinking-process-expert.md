## Description

A practical design thinking guide that helps you create user-centered solutions through empathy, ideation, and iteration. Provide your challenge details and I'll guide you through the proven 5-step design thinking process.

## Prompt

```
I'll guide you through the design thinking process to create innovative, user-centered solutions. Let me gather information about your challenge to customize our approach.

About your design challenge:
1. What problem are you trying to solve?
2. Who are your users/customers? (be specific)
3. What's the current situation or pain points?
4. What would success look like?

About your project:
5. What type of solution are you designing? (product, service, experience, process)
6. What's your timeline?
7. What resources do you have? (team, budget, tools)
8. Any constraints? (technical, regulatory, cultural)

About your users:
9. What do you already know about your users?
10. What access do you have to users for research/testing?

Based on your answers, I'll guide you through:

**1. EMPATHIZE** - Understanding your users deeply
- User research techniques specific to your context
- Empathy mapping and user journey analysis
- Key insights and unmet needs discovery

**2. DEFINE** - Framing the right problem
- Problem statement refinement  
- "How Might We" questions
- Success criteria definition

**3. IDEATE** - Generating creative solutions
- Brainstorming techniques tailored to your challenge
- Wild ideas and practical concepts
- Solution prioritization matrix

**4. PROTOTYPE** - Making ideas tangible
- Rapid prototyping methods for your solution type
- Low-fidelity to high-fidelity progression
- Testing preparation

**5. TEST** - Learning from users
- Testing methodology design
- Feedback collection strategies
- Iteration planning

Please provide the information above, and let's innovate together!

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Problem: Our company's onboarding process for new hires is confusing and leads to 40% quitting in first 90 days
2. Users: New employees ages 22-35, mostly remote, diverse backgrounds, varying tech skills
3. Current situation: 15+ different systems to learn, no clear path, overwhelmed by information dump in week 1
4. Success: 90-day retention above 85%, new hires productive within 2 weeks, positive feedback
5. Solution type: Digital onboarding experience with supporting processes
6. Timeline: 3 months to design and pilot
7. Resources: 5-person team, $100K budget, existing HR systems
8. Constraints: Must integrate with current HRIS, security compliance required
9. What we know: New hires feel lost, want mentorship, need clear progression, prefer self-paced learning
10. User access: Can interview recent hires and observe next onboarding cohort
```

**Assistant Output:**

Perfect! Let's transform your onboarding experience using design thinking. Based on your inputs, here's our customized approach:

**1. EMPATHIZE PHASE** (Week 1-2)

Let's deeply understand your new hires' experience:

**Research Plan:**
- **Exit Interviews**: Talk to 10 people who left within 90 days
- **Journey Shadowing**: Follow 5 new hires through their first week
- **Stakeholder Interviews**: HR, managers, IT, successful employees

**Empathy Map Exercise:**
- THINKS: "Am I doing this right?" "Will I succeed here?" 
- FEELS → Overwhelmed, anxious about proving themselves
- SAYS: "I don't know who to ask" "Too much information"
- DOES → Takes excessive notes, works late to catch up

**Key Insights to Explore:**
- Emotional journey from excitement to overwhelm
- Information overload vs. just-in-time learning needs
- Social isolation in remote environment

**2. DEFINE PHASE** (Week 3)

**Problem Statement:**
"New remote employees feel overwhelmed and disconnected during onboarding, leading to confusion, reduced productivity, and early departures."

**How Might We Questions:**
- HMW make new hires feel welcomed and supported from day one?
- HMW deliver information when it's actually needed?
- HMW build connections in a remote environment?
- HMW show clear progress and celebrate wins?

**Success Metrics:**
- Time to productivity: 14 days
- 90-day retention: 85%+
- Onboarding NPS: 8+
- Manager satisfaction: 80%+

**3. IDEATE PHASE** (Week 4-5)

**Brainstorming Themes:**

**A. Progressive Disclosure**
- Day 1 → Only essential access and welcome
- Week 1 → Core role basics
- Month 1 → Deeper systems and processes
- Gamified learning paths with achievements

**B. Human Connection**
- Assigned onboarding buddy from day -1
- Virtual coffee chats with team
- New hire cohort Slack channel
- Manager check-in cadence

**C. Personalized Journey**
- Role-specific learning paths
- Self-paced modules with deadlines
- Choose-your-adventure style for different learning preferences
- AI assistant for instant questions

**Top 3 Concepts to Prototype:**
1. **"Onboarding Companion App"** - Mobile-first guide with daily tasks
2. **"30-60-90 Journey"** - Phased learning with clear milestones  
3. **"New Hire Village"** - Community platform for peer support

**4. PROTOTYPE PHASE** (Week 6-8)

**Low-Fi Prototypes:**
- Paper mockups of app screens
- Journey map visualization
- Sample welcome kit contents
- Buddy program guidelines

**Medium-Fi Digital Prototype:**
- Clickable app prototype in Figma
- Sample learning modules
- Integration mockups with HRIS
- Automated check-in templates

**Prototype Testing Plan:**
- Test with 5 recent hires
- Test with 3 managers
- Test with HR team
- Security/IT review

**5. TEST PHASE** (Week 9-12)

**Pilot Program:**
- Run with next cohort (10-15 new hires)
- A/B test → Half traditional, half new approach
- Daily feedback surveys
- Weekly iteration based on feedback

**Measurement Framework:**
- Quantitative → Task completion, time spent, help requests
- Qualitative → Confidence levels, connection feelings, stress indicators
- Business → Productivity metrics, retention tracking

**Iteration Priorities:**
1. Simplify based on cognitive load feedback
2. Enhance human touchpoints if isolation persists
3. Adjust pacing based on role complexity

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Schedule stakeholder interviews this week
2. Create research protocol and consent forms
3. Set up project workspace and communication channels
4. Begin recruiting participants for research
