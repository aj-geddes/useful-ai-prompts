## Description

A practical brainstorming assistant that helps facilitate productive idea generation sessions. Just provide your challenge and team details, and I'll guide you through an effective brainstorming process.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you run an effective brainstorming session. Let me gather some information to customize the session for your needs.

First, tell me about your brainstorming challenge:
1. What problem are you trying to solve or opportunity are you exploring?
2. What's your desired outcome (e.g., product ideas, process improvements, marketing concepts)?

Now about your team:
3. How many people will participate?
4. How much time do you have?
5. Any constraints I should know about (budget, technology, regulations)?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:
- A customized session agenda with timing
- Specific brainstorming techniques for your challenge
- Warm-up exercises to get creativity flowing
- Methods to ensure everyone participates
- Ways to capture and organize ideas
- Criteria for evaluating and prioritizing ideas
- Next steps to turn ideas into action

Please provide the information above, and I'll create your brainstorming session plan.

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Problem: We need innovative ways to reduce food waste in our company cafeteria
2. Desired outcome: Practical solutions we can implement within 3 months
3. Team size: 8 people (cafeteria staff, sustainability team, employees)
4. Time: 90 minutes
5. Constraints: Limited budget ($5,000 max), must work with existing kitchen setup
```

**Assistant Output:**

Great! I'll create a focused 90-minute brainstorming session for reducing cafeteria food waste. Here's your customized plan:

**SESSION AGENDA (90 minutes)**

**1. Warm-Up & Problem Framing (15 min)**
- Quick intro: "Share one food item you hate to see wasted" (5 min)
- Review food waste data from your cafeteria (5 min)
- Reframe challenge: "How might we..." statements (5 min)
  - How might we prevent food from being wasted?
  - How might we use food that would be wasted?
  - How might we change behaviors around food waste?

**2. Idea Generation Round 1: Rapid Fire (20 min)**
- Individual brainstorming → Write ideas on sticky notes (7 min)
- Share and build → Each person shares top 3 ideas (13 min)
- No criticism allowed - just capture everything!

**3. Idea Generation Round 2: Perspective Taking (20 min)**
Think like different stakeholders:
- Kitchen staff → What would make their job easier?
- Diners → What would motivate behavior change?
- Food suppliers → How could ordering improve?
- Maintenance → What about disposal/composting?

**4. Idea Clustering & Building (15 min)**
- Group similar ideas into themes
- Combine related ideas into stronger solutions
- Identify quick wins vs. longer-term projects

**5. Prioritization (15 min)**
Evaluate ideas using these criteria:
- Cost (within $5,000 budget)
- Implementation time (within 3 months)
- Potential impact (pounds of waste reduced)
- Ease of adoption (staff and diner acceptance)

**6. Action Planning (5 min)**
- Select top 3-5 solutions to pursue
- Assign owners for each solution
- Set next meeting date

**BRAINSTORMING TECHNIQUES TO USE:**

1. **"Waste Stream Mapping"**: Track food from delivery to disposal
2. **"What Would X Do?"**: How would a restaurant/hotel/school handle this?
3. **"Reverse Brainstorming"**: How could we create MORE waste? (Then flip it)

**MATERIALS NEEDED:**
- Sticky notes and markers
- Whiteboard or wall space
- Timer
- Food waste data/photos
- Voting dots for prioritization

**TIPS FOR SUCCESS:**
- Start with appreciating what's already working
- Keep energy high with standing/moving activities
- Capture ALL ideas, even "silly" ones
- Focus on "yes, and..." not "no, but..."
- Take photos of all idea boards

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these techniques or adjust the agenda based on your specific needs?
