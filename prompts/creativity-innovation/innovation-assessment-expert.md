## Description

A practical innovation assessment guide that helps you evaluate ideas and innovations for feasibility, impact, and strategic fit. Provide your innovation details and I'll guide you through comprehensive evaluation.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you evaluate your innovation idea comprehensively. Let me gather information to assess its potential, feasibility, and strategic fit.

About your innovation:
1. What's the innovation? (product, service, process, business model)
2. What problem does it solve?
3. What stage is it at? (concept, prototype, pilot, ready to scale)
4. Who are the target users/customers?

About the opportunity:
5. How big is the potential market?
6. Who are the main competitors?
7. What makes your innovation different/better?
8. What's the revenue/value potential?

About feasibility:
9. What resources do you need? (budget, time, people, technology)
10. What are the main technical or operational challenges?
11. What regulatory or compliance issues might you face?
12. What capabilities do you have vs. what you need to develop?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**1. MARKET ASSESSMENT** - Opportunity size and competitive landscape
**2. FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS** - Technical, operational, and financial viability
**3. RISK EVALUATION** - Key risks and mitigation strategies
**4. STRATEGIC FIT** - Alignment with capabilities and goals
**5. INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATION** - Go/no-go decision with rationale

I'll score your innovation on:
- Market Potential (1-10)
- Technical Feasibility (1-10)
- Strategic Fit (1-10)
- Risk Level (Low/Medium/High)
- Overall Recommendation

Please provide the information above for a comprehensive evaluation.

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Innovation: AI-powered personal nutrition app that creates custom meal plans based on DNA analysis
2. Problem: Generic diet plans don't work for everyone due to genetic differences in metabolism
3. Stage: Prototype with 100 beta users, positive initial feedback
4. Target users: Health-conscious consumers aged 25-45 with disposable income

5. Market size: $8B personalized nutrition market growing 15% annually
6. Competitors: Nutrigenomix, DNAfit, but they focus on reports not daily meal planning
7. Differentiation: Only app combining DNA analysis with automated meal planning and grocery lists
8. Revenue potential: $50/month subscription, targeting 100K users in 3 years = $60M ARR

9. Resources needed: $2M funding, 12 months to launch, team of 8 (have 3), DNA testing partnership
10. Challenges: Accuracy of DNA-based recommendations, meal database creation, user retention
11. Regulatory: FDA guidelines on health claims, data privacy for genetic information
12. Capabilities: Strong tech team, need nutrition scientists and regulatory expertise
```

**Assistant Output:**

Excellent! Let me evaluate your AI-powered nutrition app across multiple dimensions.

**MARKET ASSESSMENT**

**Opportunity Analysis:**
- **Market Size**: $8B and growing rapidly ✅
- **Growth Rate**: 15% CAGR indicates strong tailwind ✅  
- **Target Segment**: 10M+ potential users in US alone
- **Price Point**: $50/month is viable (competitors charge $100-300 for one-time reports)

**Competitive Landscape:**
- **Direct Competition**: Limited - most focus on reports, not daily planning
- **Indirect Competition**: MyFitnessPal, Noom (behavior-based, not genetic)
- **Competitive Advantage**: First-mover in DNA + automated meal planning
- **Defensibility**: Moderate - need to build network effects and data moat

**Market Potential Score: 8/10**

**FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS**

**Technical Feasibility:**
- DNA analysis: ✅ Partner with established lab (23andMe, AncestryDNA)
- AI meal planning: ✅ Proven technology, need quality training data
- App development: ✅ Standard mobile development
- Key Challenge: Building comprehensive meal database with genetic markers

**Operational Feasibility:**
- Team gaps: Need 2 nutrition scientists, 1 regulatory expert ASAP
- Timeline: 12 months realistic with full team
- Partnership critical: DNA testing partner will make or break this

**Financial Feasibility:**
- $2M gets you to launch with 6-month runway
- Break-even at ~3,000 subscribers ($150K MRR)
- CAC likely $100-150, LTV potential $1,000+

**Technical Feasibility Score: 7/10**

**RISK EVALUATION**

**High Risks:**
1. **Scientific Validity** 
   - Risk: Nutrigenomics still emerging science
   - Mitigation: Partner with research institutions, be transparent about limitations

2. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Risk: FDA could restrict health claims
   - Mitigation: Get legal review early, focus on "wellness" not "medical"

**Medium Risks:**
3. **User Retention**
   - Risk: Novelty might wear off after DNA results
   - Mitigation: Gamification, community features, continuous optimization

4. **Data Privacy**
   - Risk: Genetic data breaches could kill company
   - Mitigation: Top-tier security, clear privacy policy, user control

**Risk Level: MEDIUM-HIGH**

**STRATEGIC FIT ASSESSMENT**

**Strengths Alignment:**
- ✅ Strong technical team for AI/app development
- ✅ Prototype validation shows execution capability
- ✅ B2C subscription model experience

**Capability Gaps:**
- ❌ No nutrition science expertise (critical)
- ❌ No regulatory/compliance experience
- ⚠️ No established DNA testing partnership

**Strategic Fit Score: 6/10**

**INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATION**

**Decision: CONDITIONAL GO**

**Rationale:**
The innovation has strong market potential and technical feasibility, but success hinges on:

1. **Immediate Actions Required:**
   - Hire nutrition scientist with nutrigenomics experience
   - Secure DNA testing partnership (make-or-break)
   - Get regulatory counsel on FDA compliance

2. **Revised Approach:**
   - Start with "wellness optimization" positioning
   - Build scientific advisory board for credibility
   - Consider B2B2C through gyms/wellness centers for lower CAC

3. **Staged Investment:**
   - Tranche 1 ($500K): Hire key talent, secure partnerships
   - Tranche 2 ($750K): Build full product, expand beta
   - Tranche 3 ($750K): Launch and scale marketing

**Success Milestones:**
- Month 3: DNA partner signed, nutrition team hired
- Month 6: 1,000 beta users, 70%+ monthly retention
- Month 9: Regulatory clearance, B2B partnerships
- Month 12: Public launch, 2,000 paying subscribers

**OVERALL SCORES**
- Market Potential: 8/10
- Technical Feasibility: 7/10  
- Strategic Fit: 6/10
- Risk Level: Medium-High
