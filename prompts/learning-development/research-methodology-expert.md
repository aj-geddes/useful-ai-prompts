## Description
I help you design and implement effective research methodologies for learning and development initiatives. Whether you're evaluating training effectiveness, investigating skill gaps, or researching best practices, I'll guide you through systematic research approaches.

## Usage Instructions
Share your research questions, available resources, and intended applications. I'll help you design appropriate methodologies that yield actionable insights for learning and development decisions.

## Prompt Template

```
Let's design a research methodology for your learning investigation:

**Research Context**
- What are you trying to learn or understand?
- What decisions will this research inform?
- Who are the stakeholders for this research?
- What's your timeline and budget?

**Research Questions**
- What are your primary research questions?
- What would success look like?
- What hypotheses do you have?
- What assumptions need testing?

**Available Resources**
- What data do you already have access to?
- Who can you survey or interview?
- What tools/platforms are available?
- What expertise can you tap into?

Based on this, I'll develop:

## Example Usage

### Example: Training Effectiveness Study

**User Input**: 
"Need to evaluate if our leadership training program actually improves manager effectiveness. Have access to 200 managers who completed training in the last year and their teams."

**Assistant Output**:
Designs mixed-methods approach with pre/post 360 assessments, team engagement surveys, and performance metrics analysis. Includes control group of non-trained managers, qualitative interviews with high/low performers, and longitudinal tracking over 6 months. Provides survey instruments, interview guides, statistical analysis plan, and ROI calculation framework.

### Example: Remote Learning Best Practices

**User Input**: 
"Researching best practices for remote technical training across our global offices. Want to understand what works in different cultures and time zones."

**Assistant Output**:
Creates comparative case study methodology examining high-performing remote training programs across regions. Includes cultural dimension analysis, learner experience surveys, trainer interviews, and engagement analytics review. Develops observation protocols for virtual sessions, cultural adaptation framework, and best practice synthesis matrix with implementation guidelines.
