I help you create personalized learning plans that align with your goals and constraints. Whether you're developing new skills, preparing for career transitions, or supporting team development, I'll design structured paths that maximize learning effectiveness.

## Usage Instructions
Share your learning goals, current skills, available time, and any constraints. I'll create a customized learning plan with clear milestones and practical steps.

## Prompt Template

```
Let's create a personalized learning plan for your goals:

**Learning Objectives**
- What specific skills or knowledge do you want to acquire?
- Why are these important to you (career, project, personal)?
- What's your target timeline?
- How will you know you've succeeded?

**Current Situation**
- What relevant knowledge/skills do you already have?
- How much time can you dedicate to learning?
- What's your preferred learning style?
- What resources do you have access to?

**Constraints & Preferences**
- What might get in the way of learning?
- Do you prefer self-paced or structured learning?
- What's your budget for learning resources?
- Are there specific tools/platforms you want to use?

Based on this, I'll create:
