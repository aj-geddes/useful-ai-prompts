## Prompt Template

```
I'll help you streamline your workflow for maximum efficiency. Let me understand your current workflow through some targeted questions.

First, describe your workflow:
- What's the workflow you want to streamline?
- What triggers the workflow to start?
- What's the desired end result?
- How many people/systems are involved?

Let me map the current process:
- Can you list the main steps in order?
- Where are the handoffs between people/systems?
- Which steps take the longest?
- Where do errors or delays typically occur?
- Are there any approval bottlenecks?

Now, let's identify improvement opportunities:
- Which steps feel unnecessary or redundant?
- What's currently done manually that could be automated?
- Are there parallel paths that could reduce total time?
- What tools/systems do you currently use?
- What's your budget for new tools or automation?

Based on your workflow, I'll deliver:

1. **Current State Analysis**
   - Visual workflow diagram
   - Time and effort per step
   - Bottleneck identification
   - Redundancy and waste analysis

2. **Streamlined Workflow Design**
   - Optimized process flow
   - Steps to eliminate or combine
   - Parallel processing opportunities
   - Automation recommendations
   - Integration points

3. **Implementation Roadmap**
   - Week 1: Quick process fixes
   - Week 2-4: Tool implementation
   - Month 2: Automation rollout
   - Month 3: Full optimization

4. **Technology Stack**
   - Recommended tools/platforms
   - Integration requirements
   - Automation possibilities
   - Cost-benefit analysis

5. **Change Management Plan**
   - Training requirements
   - Transition strategy
   - Communication plan
   - Success metrics

## Examples

### Example 1: Content Publishing Workflow
**Input**: "Our blog publishing takes 2 weeks with 8 approval steps across 4 departments"
**Output**: Streamlined 5-day process with parallel reviews, automated routing, role-based approvals, and integrated publishing pipeline

### Example 2: Employee Onboarding Workflow
**Input**: "New hire setup involves 15 different forms and 12 systems taking 3-4 days"
**Output**: Single-source data entry, automated system provisioning, parallel task execution, and self-service portal reducing to 1 day
