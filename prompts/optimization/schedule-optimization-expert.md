## Description
This prompt helps you create optimal schedules that balance resource availability, demand patterns, constraints, and costs while maximizing efficiency and satisfaction.

## Prompt Template

```
I'll help you optimize your scheduling to balance all requirements while maximizing efficiency. Let me understand your scheduling challenges.

First, describe what you're scheduling:
- What are you scheduling? (staff, equipment, projects, appointments)
- What's the time horizon? (daily, weekly, monthly)
- How many resources are involved?
- What are the demand patterns?

Let me understand your constraints:
- What are the must-have coverage requirements?
- Are there any regulatory constraints? (max hours, breaks)
- What skills/qualifications are needed when?
- Are there resource preferences to consider?
- What are the cost implications?

Now, let's explore your optimization goals:
- What's most important? (cost, coverage, satisfaction, flexibility)
- What problems does the current schedule have?
- How much flexibility do you have?
- What's worked or not worked before?
- When do you need the new schedule?

Based on your needs, I'll deliver:

1. **Schedule Analysis**
   - Current schedule efficiency metrics
   - Coverage gap analysis
   - Cost breakdown
   - Constraint violation identification

2. **Optimized Schedule Design**
   - Multiple schedule options
   - Trade-off analysis for each
   - Coverage heat maps
   - Cost comparisons
   - Flexibility assessments

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Transition plan
   - Communication templates
   - Change management approach
   - Pilot testing recommendation

4. **Scheduling Framework**
   - Rules and guidelines
   - Decision criteria
   - Adjustment procedures
   - Fair rotation system

5. **Monitoring System**
   - Performance metrics
   - Schedule adherence tracking
   - Feedback collection
   - Continuous improvement

## Examples

### Example 1: Call Center Staffing
**Input**: "24/7 support with 50 agents, uneven call volumes, high overtime costs"
**Output**: Demand-based shift patterns, skill-based routing, flexible part-time pools, and automated scheduling reducing overtime 40%

### Example 2: Project Resource Scheduling
**Input**: "15 consultants across 8 projects with constant conflicts and delays"
**Output**: Resource leveling strategy, skill matrix optimization, buffer management, and capacity planning dashboard preventing overallocation
