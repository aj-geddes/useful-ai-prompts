## Example Usage

### Input

"CTO leading digital transformation. Resistance from traditional business units. 2-year timeline. CEO supportive but business unit heads skeptical. Need to build coalition and demonstrate value."

### Output

**Strategic Leadership Plan: Digital Transformation Leadership**

**1. Strategic Assessment**
Position analysis:

- Authority: High technical authority, limited business authority
- Support: CEO backing provides air cover but not ground support
- Resistance: Business units see transformation as threat to autonomy/resources
- Challenge: Technical leader needing to lead business change

Strategic landscape:

- External pressure: Competitors digitizing, market expects it
- Internal reality: Skeptics have valid concerns (disruption, risk, past failures)
- Opportunity: Position transformation as enablement, not takeover
- Risk: Transformation seen as "IT project" vs. business transformation

Key insight: Your success depends on business unit leaders becoming advocates, not opponents. This is a coalition-building challenge as much as a technology challenge.

**2. Vision and Priorities**
Transformation vision:

- Not: "We will digitize operations and modernize systems"
- Instead: "We will equip every business unit to win in a digital market"

Strategic priorities (Year 1):

1. Quick wins with willing partners (prove value, build credibility)
2. Build internal digital capability (not just buy technology)
3. Create shared success stories (make heroes of business leaders)

Strategic priorities (Year 2):

1. Scale successful patterns across business units
2. Establish digital as competitive advantage (customer/revenue impact)
3. Embed digital thinking into business strategy

Success metrics:

- Business unit satisfaction with digital initiatives
- Revenue impact attributable to digital capabilities
- Internal capability growth (skills, not just systems)

**3. Stakeholder Engagement**
Stakeholder mapping:

| Stakeholder       | Current Position | Target Position | Strategy                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| CEO               | Supportive       | Active champion | Regular updates, use their voice          |
| CFO               | Neutral          | Supportive      | ROI focus, risk management                |
| BU Head A         | Skeptical        | Willing partner | Find their pain point, co-create solution |
| BU Head B         | Resistant        | Neutral         | Don't fight, work around initially        |
| BU Head C         | Interested       | Champion        | Give them early win, make them hero       |
| Middle management | Varied           | Engaged         | Address WIIFM, involve in design          |

Coalition-building sequence:

- Month 1-3: Win BU Head C with high-visibility quick win
- Month 4-6: Use BU C success to engage BU A
- Month 6-12: Build momentum, let success attract skeptics
- Year 2: Address remaining resistance from position of strength

Key conversation approach (for skeptics):

- Lead with listening: "Help me understand your biggest challenges"
- Connect digital to their goals: "What if we could address [their pain] with [capability]?"
- Offer partnership, not mandate: "I want to support your success, not take over"
- Start small, prove value: "Let's pilot something low-risk and see results"

**4. Strategic Communication**
Narrative framework:

- For CEO/Board: "Digital transformation positions us for market leadership. Here's the roadmap and ROI."
- For business units: "We're here to help you win. Digital capabilities are your competitive weapons."
- For middle management: "You'll have better tools, clearer processes, and skills for the future."
- For all employees: "We're investing in our future. Here's how it affects you."

Communication cadence:

- Monthly: Transformation newsletter highlighting successes and progress
- Quarterly: Town hall with business leader testimonials
- Ongoing: Story collection and sharing (make others the heroes)
- As needed: 1:1 stakeholder updates tailored to their concerns

Communication principles:

- Business outcomes, not technology features
- Stories and examples, not just metrics
- Acknowledge challenges honestly, show path through them
- Credit partners, especially business leaders who take risks

**5. Execution Roadmap**
90-day plan:

- Week 1-2: Stakeholder listening tour (30-min 1:1 with each BU head)
- Week 3-4: Identify 2-3 quick win opportunities with willing partners
- Month 2: Kick off highest-potential quick win
- Month 3: Deliver and communicate first success

Year 1 milestones:

- Q1: First quick win delivered and celebrated
- Q2: Second initiative launched, first business unit advocate identified
- Q3: Success pattern documented and shared
- Q4: 3+ business units engaged, transformation momentum visible

Accountability mechanisms:

- Monthly SteerCo with CEO (progress, decisions, escalations)
- Quarterly board update (strategic progress, not technical details)
- Transformation dashboard (business outcomes, not IT metrics)

Personal leadership development:

- Executive coaching: Navigate political dynamics, build influence
- Peer network: Connect with other transformation leaders (outside org)
- Visibility: Speak at industry events, build external credibility
- Self-care: Transformation is marathon, protect energy and resilience
