## Example Usage

### Input

"Team split between Silicon Valley (8 people) and Bangalore (12 people). US team complains Indian team doesn't push back enough. Indian team feels US team is rude and dismissive. I'm the US-based manager."

### Output

**Cross-Cultural Leadership Plan: US-India Team Integration**

**1. Cultural Mapping**
Key cultural dimension differences (general patterns, not absolutes):

| Dimension     | US Team Tendency          | India Team Tendency       |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Communication | Direct, explicit          | Indirect, contextual      |
| Hierarchy     | Flat, challenge authority | Respect for seniority     |
| Feedback      | Public debate encouraged  | Face-saving important     |
| Commitment    | "No" is acceptable        | "Yes" may mean "I'll try" |
| Time          | Task-focused              | Relationship-focused      |

Friction translation:

- "Doesn't push back" = Indian team showing respect, expecting you to read between lines
- "Rude and dismissive" = US team's directness landing as disrespectful

Important caveat: These are patterns, not rules. Get to know individuals. Many Indian engineers in global companies have adapted to direct communication; some US team members may prefer indirect styles.

**2. Inclusive Meeting Practices**
Time zone fairness:

- Rotate meeting times so inconvenience is shared
- No standing meetings at 10pm for either team
- Record important meetings for async consumption
- Alternate which team's workday hosts important decisions

Participation equity:

- Pre-meeting: Share agenda 24 hours ahead with specific questions
- "Thinking time": After posing question, wait 10 seconds before calling on anyone
- Round-robin input: "Let's go around - I'd like to hear from everyone on this"
- Private channel: Allow anonymous questions via chat during meetings
- Follow-up: "For those who prefer to think it over, send thoughts by tomorrow"

Decision-making adaptation:

- Make decision process explicit: "I'm gathering input now; I'll decide by Friday"
- Create safe channels for disagreement: "Before we commit, what could go wrong?"
- 1:1 pre-meetings with Indian leads: "What concerns should I be aware of?"

**3. Communication Guidelines**
For US team (your coaching):

- Soften directness without losing clarity: "What are your thoughts on..." instead of "You should..."
- Acknowledge before critiquing: "I see the logic here. What if we also considered..."
- Ask, don't assume silence = agreement: "Does this work? I want to hear concerns."
- Slow down: US pace can feel steamrolling

For India team (through your counterpart there):

- Explicit disagreement is valued: "It's safe and expected to say 'I have a concern'"
- Direct doesn't mean disrespectful: "Americans appreciate bluntness; it's not personal"
- Escalation is okay: "If you disagree with direction, please tell me"
- Say "no" when you mean no: "I'd rather hear 'this will take longer' than miss deadline"

**4. Integration Activities**
Relationship building:

- Virtual coffee pairings (cross-site buddy system)
- Share personal context: "2 truths and a lie" or similar icebreakers
- Celebrate both cultures: Diwali, Thanksgiving, team anniversaries
- If budget allows: Periodic in-person gatherings (even 1x/year transforms relationships)

Cultural learning:

- "Culture exchange" sessions: Each side presents on their work culture norms
- Share "user manual" documents: How each person prefers to communicate
- Create shared team charter including communication norms decided together

Your leadership actions:

- Visit India site (or vice versa) to build relationships
- Hire/promote local leadership in India with real authority
- Publicly recognize contributions from both sites equally
- Call out good cross-cultural collaboration when you see it
