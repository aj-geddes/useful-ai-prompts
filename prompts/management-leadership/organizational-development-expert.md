## Example Usage

### Input

"We grew from 100 to 300 employees in 18 months. Losing startup culture, processes breaking down, middle management layer is new and struggling, communication is fragmented."

### Output

**Organizational Development Strategy: Scaling Through Growth**

**1. Assessment**
Current state diagnosis:

- Structure: Evolved organically, unclear decision rights, spans of control too wide
- Culture: Startup DNA diluted, "us vs. them" forming between old and new
- Processes: Tribal knowledge, inconsistent practices, bottlenecks at founders
- Leadership: New managers promoted from IC roles, limited management training
- Communication: What worked at 100 breaks at 300, information silos emerging

Root causes:

- Growth outpaced organizational infrastructure
- Cultural transmission mechanisms didn't scale
- Management layer added without development
- Decision-making still centralized in founders

**2. Development Initiatives**
Priority 1: Leadership Development (Months 1-6)

- Problem: New managers lack skills, creating bottlenecks and employee frustration
- Initiative: Manager Foundations Program
- Approach: Cohort-based training, peer support groups, coaching for high-potential
- Expected outcome: Managers can lead, develop, and make decisions independently

Priority 2: Organizational Clarity (Months 2-8)

- Problem: Unclear who decides what, redundant meetings, slow decisions
- Initiative: Role Clarity and Decision Rights
- Approach: RACI mapping, decision authority documentation, meeting audit
- Expected outcome: Faster decisions, reduced meeting load, clear accountability

Priority 3: Culture Reinforcement (Months 3-12)

- Problem: Original culture diluting, new hires don't feel connected
- Initiative: Culture Ambassador Program
- Approach: Define explicit values, activate culture carriers, integrate into hiring/onboarding
- Expected outcome: Values consistently lived, new hires acculturated faster

Priority 4: Scalable Processes (Months 6-18)

- Problem: Tribal knowledge, inconsistent practices, founders as bottleneck
- Initiative: Process Documentation and Enablement
- Approach: Document top 20 critical processes, create playbooks, enable self-service
- Expected outcome: Consistent execution without founder involvement

**3. Design Blueprint**
Organizational structure adjustment:

- Current: Functional silos, 15+ direct reports to some leaders
- Proposed: Add team lead layer, target 6-8 direct reports max
- Decision rights: Push routine decisions down, reserve strategic for leadership

Role clarity framework:

- For each function: Document decisions they own vs. consult vs. escalate
- For each manager: Clear scope of authority, when to act vs. ask
- For cross-functional: RACI for top 10 recurring collaboration scenarios

Culture reinforcement mechanisms:

- Values integration: Add to hiring scorecards, performance reviews, recognition
- Rituals: Preserve what made startup culture special (adapt for scale)
- Storytelling: Share company history and values through regular narrative
- New hire experience: Pair with "culture buddy" from pre-growth era

**4. Implementation Roadmap**
Months 1-3: Foundation

- Launch Manager Foundations Program (first cohort)
- Begin decision rights mapping with leadership team
- Define values explicitly (involve cross-section of employees)

Months 4-6: Build

- Complete decision rights documentation
- Roll out role clarity to all managers
- Launch Culture Ambassador Program
- Reduce founder meeting involvement by 30%

Months 7-12: Embed

- Second cohort of Manager Foundations
- Process documentation sprint (top 20 processes)
- Culture integration into all people processes
- Measure and adjust based on feedback

Months 13-18: Sustain

- Transition programs to internal ownership
- Continuous improvement of processes
- Manager community of practice (ongoing peer learning)

**5. Capability Building**
Manager Foundations curriculum:

- Module 1: Feedback and coaching conversations
- Module 2: Goal setting and performance management
- Module 3: Team dynamics and delegation
- Module 4: Difficult conversations and conflict
- Module 5: Leading through change

Success metrics:

- Employee engagement scores (target: maintain or improve)
- Manager effectiveness rating (from direct reports)
- Decision cycle time (target: 30% reduction)
- Voluntary turnover of high performers (target: below 10%)
- New hire cultural integration (30-day survey)
