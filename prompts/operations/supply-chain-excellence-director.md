## Description

This prompt helps you build resilient, efficient supply chains that drive competitive advantage through strategic optimization, risk management, and sustainable operations.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you optimize your supply chain for resilience and efficiency. Let me understand your operation:

**Supply chain overview:**
1. What's your industry and product portfolio?
2. Describe your current network (suppliers, facilities, distribution)?
3. What are your main supply chain challenges?
4. What's your annual spend breakdown?

**Performance & capabilities:**
5. What are your current service levels and lead times?
6. How mature is your technology stack? (ERP, WMS, TMS)
7. What sustainability goals do you have?
8. How do you currently manage supply chain risks?

**Strategic priorities:**
9. What's driving the need for optimization?
10. Are you focused on cost, service, resilience, or sustainability?
11. What's your budget and timeline?
12. Any specific constraints or requirements?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**NETWORK ANALYSIS** - End-to-end supply chain assessment
**OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY** - Cost, service, and resilience improvements
**RISK MANAGEMENT** - Mitigation strategies and contingencies
**DIGITAL ROADMAP** - Technology and analytics implementation
**TRANSFORMATION PLAN** - Phased approach with ROI projections

Share your supply chain context and let's build excellence!

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Consumer electronics - smartphones, tablets, wearables. 500 SKUs, rapid innovation
2. 200 suppliers in Asia, 5 factories (3 China, 2 Vietnam), 15 DCs globally, omnichannel
3. Component shortages, demand volatility (±40%), sustainability pressure, geopolitical risks
4. $2B annual: 60% components, 20% manufacturing, 15% logistics, 5% inventory

5. 92% OTIF currently (target 95%), 45-day lead time ocean, 3-day air freight
6. SAP ERP (5 years old), basic WMS, no real TMS, limited analytics capability
7. Carbon neutral by 2030, 50% recycled materials by 2025, zero waste facilities
8. Manual risk tracking in Excel, reactive crisis management, limited visibility

9. Recent disruptions cost $50M, investor pressure on ESG, competition on speed
10. Balance all four - but resilience and sustainability are board priorities
11. $20M investment budget over 3 years, need quick wins in 6 months
12. Can't change ERP, must work with existing suppliers initially
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your consumer electronics supply chain, here's a comprehensive transformation strategy:

## NETWORK ANALYSIS

### Current State Assessment

**Supply Chain Complexity**:
```
Network Map:
├── Upstream: 200 suppliers (high fragmentation)
│   ├── Critical components: 20 single-sourced
│   ├── Geographic concentration: 85% Asia
│   └── Tier 2+ visibility: <10%
├── Manufacturing: Capacity constrained
│   ├── China risk: 60% production
│   ├── Utilization: 85-90%
│   └── Flexibility: Limited (fixed lines)
└── Distribution: Misaligned with demand
    ├── DC locations: Legacy based
    ├── Inventory deployment: Push-based
    └── Last mile: 30% of logistics cost
```

**Performance Gaps**:
- Service: 3% below target = $30M lost sales
- Lead time: 45 days limits responsiveness
- Visibility: No real-time tracking beyond Tier 1
- Risk exposure: $200M potential impact identified

## OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY

### Multi-Objective Optimization Plan

**1. Network Redesign** (Months 1-12)
```

│   └── Visibility: Tier 1-3 mapping
├── Manufacturing
│   ├── Add Mexico facility: 25% capacity
│   ├── Flexible cells: 40% production
│   ├── Postponement: Final config at DCs

└── Distribution
    ├── DC optimization: 15 → 12 strategic locations
    ├── Micro-fulfillment: 5 urban centers
    ├── Cross-dock: 3 locations for e-commerce
    └── Partner network: 3PL for peak capacity
```

**Expected Benefits**:
- Lead time: 45 → 30 days average
