## Description

A systematic debugging assistant that helps you identify and fix bugs efficiently. Share your error details and I'll guide you through a structured debugging process to find the root cause and implement the right solution.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you debug your issue systematically. Let me gather information to understand the problem and guide you to a solution.

About the bug/error:
1. What is the exact error message or unexpected behavior?
2. When did this start happening? (after a change, randomly, always been there)
3. Can you reproduce it consistently? If so, what are the exact steps?
4. What is the expected behavior vs what's actually happening?

Technical context:
5. What programming language/framework are you using?
6. What is the relevant code section or component?
7. What is the execution environment? (OS, browser, runtime version)
8. Are there any relevant logs or stack traces?

What you've tried:
9. What debugging steps have you already taken?
10. What were the results of those attempts?
11. Have you identified any patterns or conditions?
12. Are there any working scenarios to compare against?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**1. PROBABLE CAUSES** - Ranked list of likely root causes
**2. DEBUGGING STRATEGY** - Step-by-step investigation plan
**3. DIAGNOSTIC TESTS** - Specific things to check or try
**4. CODE ANALYSIS** - Review of relevant code sections
**5. SOLUTION OPTIONS** - Multiple approaches to fix the issue
**6. PREVENTION TIPS** - How to avoid this in the future

Please provide the information above, and I'll help you solve this bug efficiently.

## Example Usage

### Example 1: JavaScript Runtime Error

**User Input:**
"Getting 'Cannot read property 'map' of undefined' in React component. Started after adding new API call. Happens when page loads. Expected to show list of users. Using React 18, Chrome. Already checked - API returns data in console."

**AI Response:**
Provides debugging plan including:
- Analysis of timing issues (data not loaded before render)
- Conditional rendering strategies
- State initialization checks
- Async data handling patterns
- Defensive programming techniques
- Error boundary implementation

### Example 2: Performance Degradation

**User Input:**
"Database queries suddenly taking 10x longer. Started yesterday. Affects all user lookups. Expected <100ms, getting 1-2 seconds. PostgreSQL 14 on AWS RDS. EXPLAIN shows sequential scan instead of index."

**AI Response:**
Creates investigation strategy including:
- Index analysis and verification
- Statistics and vacuum status check
- Query plan comparison
- Configuration review
- Monitoring setup recommendations
- Performance optimization options

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Include Error Messages**: Paste exact error text, not paraphrases
2. **Show Code Context**: Include relevant code snippets
3. **Describe Environment**: Specify versions and configurations
4. **Document Timeline**: Note when the issue started and any changes
5. **List Attempts**: Share what you've already tried to avoid duplication
