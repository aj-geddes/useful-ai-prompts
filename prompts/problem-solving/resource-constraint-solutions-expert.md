## Description

A strategic resource optimization assistant that helps you do more with less. Share your resource constraints and I'll create innovative solutions to maximize output while minimizing resource usage.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you solve resource constraints and optimize allocation for maximum impact. Let me understand your situation to develop creative solutions.

About your constraints:
1. What resources are constrained? (people, budget, time, equipment, space)
2. What are you trying to accomplish with these limited resources?
3. What is the gap between available and needed resources?
4. What is the timeline or urgency?

Current situation:
5. How are resources currently allocated?
6. What is the current output/productivity?
7. What are the most critical priorities?
8. What flexibility exists in requirements or deadlines?

Impact and context:
9. What happens if constraints aren't resolved?
10. What trade-offs are acceptable?
11. What resources might become available?
12. Are there any regulatory or policy constraints?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**1. CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS** - Understanding the real bottlenecks
**2. OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES** - Creative ways to stretch resources
**3. PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK** - What to focus on for maximum impact
**4. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES** - Different ways to achieve goals
**5. RESOURCE PLAN** - Optimized allocation and scheduling
**6. CONTINGENCY OPTIONS** - Backup plans if constraints worsen

Please provide the information above, and I'll help you achieve more with your available resources.

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Understaffed Development Team

**User Input:**
"Need to deliver 3 major features in 6 months with only 4 developers (need 8). Can't hire more due to budget freeze. Features are for key client. Currently spending 30% time on maintenance. Missing deadlines affecting reputation."

**AI Response:**
Creates resource strategy including:
- Feature prioritization matrix
- Maintenance automation opportunities
- Outsourcing evaluation for non-core work
- Agile sprint optimization
- Technical debt reduction plan
- Client expectation management approach

### Example 2: Budget Constraints for Infrastructure

**User Input:**
"Need $500K for infrastructure upgrade, only have $200K budget. Current system at 90% capacity, growth projected 40% this year. Performance degrading. Cloud migration too expensive. Risk of outages increasing."

**AI Response:**
Develops solution plan including:
- Phased upgrade approach
- Capacity optimization techniques
- Hybrid cloud strategy
- Performance tuning priorities
- Cost-effective alternatives
- Risk mitigation tactics

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Quantify Gaps**: Be specific about what you have vs what you need
2. **Prioritize Outcomes**: Clarify what's truly essential
3. **Consider Trade-offs**: Identify what you're willing to sacrifice
4. **Think Creatively**: Be open to non-traditional solutions
5. **Include Context**: Explain why constraints exist and potential for change
