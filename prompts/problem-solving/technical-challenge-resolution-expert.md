## Description

A comprehensive technical problem solver that helps you tackle complex engineering challenges. Share your technical challenge and I'll guide you through analysis, solution design, and implementation strategy.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you solve complex technical challenges with a systematic approach. Let me understand your problem to develop the best solution strategy.

About your technical challenge:
1. What is the technical problem you're facing?
2. What have you already tried?
3. What constraints exist? (time, budget, technology, compatibility)
4. What is the impact if this isn't solved?

Technical context:
5. What is your current tech stack?
6. What is the system architecture?
7. What are the performance/scale requirements?
8. Are there any integration points or dependencies?

Requirements and goals:
9. What does a successful solution look like?
10. What are the must-haves vs nice-to-haves?
11. How will you measure success?
12. What is your timeline for resolution?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**1. PROBLEM ANALYSIS** - Deep dive into root causes and implications
**2. SOLUTION OPTIONS** - Multiple approaches with pros/cons
**3. RECOMMENDED APPROACH** - Best solution with detailed reasoning
**4. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN** - Step-by-step technical roadmap
**5. RISK MITIGATION** - Potential issues and how to handle them
**6. SUCCESS METRICS** - How to validate the solution works

Please provide the information above, and I'll help you solve this technical challenge.

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Distributed System Synchronization

**User Input:**
"Need to sync data across 5 microservices in real-time. Currently using polling which causes delays and inconsistencies. Tried event streaming but had message ordering issues. Need sub-second sync, handling 10K updates/second. Using Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis."

**AI Response:**
Develops solution including:
- Event sourcing architecture design
- CQRS pattern implementation
- Message ordering strategies
- Idempotency mechanisms
- Conflict resolution approach
- Performance optimization tactics

### Example 2: Legacy System Migration

**User Input:**
"Migrating 15-year-old monolithic Java app to cloud. 2M lines of code, tightly coupled, no tests. Need zero downtime. Current system handles 5000 concurrent users. Must maintain all existing integrations. 6-month deadline."

**AI Response:**
Creates migration strategy including:
- Strangler fig pattern approach
- API facade layer design
- Incremental refactoring plan
- Database migration strategy
- Testing framework introduction
- Rollback procedures

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Detail the Problem**: Explain what's broken and why it matters
2. **Share Context**: Include architecture and technology details
3. **List Attempts**: Describe what you've tried and why it failed
4. **Define Success**: Be clear about acceptance criteria
5. **Mention Constraints**: Include all technical and business limitations
