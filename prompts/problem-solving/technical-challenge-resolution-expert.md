### TECHNICAL CHALLENGE ANALYSIS

#### Deep Dive Problem Decomposition

**Challenge Component Analysis**:

**Latency Challenge Decomposition**:

```
Total Latency Budget: 100ms
├── Network Latency: 15-25ms (global distribution)
├── Data Retrieval: 10-15ms (customer history, device data)
├── Feature Engineering: 5-10ms (real-time feature computation)
├── AI Model Inference: 20-30ms (fraud probability calculation)
├── Decision Logic: 5-10ms (risk scoring and decision)
├── Response Generation: 5-10ms (result formatting and return)
└── Buffer/Overhead: 10-15ms (system overhead and safety margin)

Critical Path Analysis:
1. Data retrieval often exceeds budget due to distributed lookups
2. AI model inference varies significantly based on model complexity
3. Feature engineering becomes bottleneck with complex transaction patterns
4. Network latency multiplies with geographic distribution
```

**Scale Challenge Analysis**:

```
Current Volume: 50M transactions/day (578 TPS average, 2,000 TPS peak)
Target Volume: 200M transactions/day (2,315 TPS average, 10,000 TPS peak)

Scaling Factors:
├── Geographic Distribution: 200+ countries requiring local processing
├── Data Volume: 100TB+ transaction data daily requiring real-time analysis
├── Model Complexity: 50+ ML models for different fraud types and regions
├── Regulatory Compliance: Country-specific data residency and privacy requirements
└── Infrastructure Cost: Linear scaling would require 400% infrastructure investment

Scaling Bottlenecks:
1. Database performance degrades exponentially with geographic distribution
2. Model synchronization across regions becomes communications bottleneck
3. Feature store performance doesn't scale linearly with transaction volume
4. Regulatory compliance requires data isolation limiting global optimization
