## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Algorithm type: Data processing algorithm for log analysis
2. Function: Parse web server logs and generate user behavior analytics
3. Current complexity: O(n²) - nested loops through log entries and user sessions
4. Language: Python

5. Performance issues: Takes 4 hours to process daily logs (50GB), memory usage spikes to 32GB
6. Input size: 50GB daily log files, 10M log entries, 500K unique users
7. Requirements: Process within 30 minutes, use <8GB memory, real-time capability preferred
8. Hardware: Single server with 16 cores, 64GB RAM

9. Profiling: 80% time in nested user-session matching loops
10. Bottleneck: Finding user sessions across log entries requires comparing every entry
11. Accuracy trade-offs: 95%+ accuracy required, some approximation acceptable for speed
12. Priority: Speed first, then memory usage
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your log analysis algorithm, here's your optimization strategy:

# LOG ANALYSIS ALGORITHM OPTIMIZATION PLAN

## 1. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

### Current Algorithm Issues
**Time Complexity:** O(n²) due to nested loops
- **Primary Bottleneck:** User-session matching across 10M log entries
- **Secondary Issue:** Memory inefficient data structures storing full dataset
- **Scalability Problem:** Quadratic growth means 4x data = 16x processing time

**Memory Usage Analysis:**
- **32GB Peak:** Loading entire dataset into memory at once
- **Inefficient Storage:** Redundant data structures for user tracking
- **Memory Fragmentation:** Large objects causing garbage collection delays

### Root Cause Identification
```python
# Current problematic approach
def analyze_logs_current(log_entries):
    user_sessions = {}
    # BOTTLENECK 1: O(n²) nested iteration
    for entry in log_entries:  # 10M entries
        for existing_session in user_sessions.values():  # Up to 500K sessions
            if matches_session(entry, existing_session):  # Expensive comparison
                existing_session.add_entry(entry)
                break
        else:
            # Create new session - memory inefficient
            user_sessions[entry.user_id] = UserSession([entry])
    
    return generate_analytics(user_sessions)  # Another O(n) pass
```

## 2. OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: Hash-Based Session Mapping (Primary Optimization)
**Complexity Improvement:** O(n²) → O(n)
**Implementation:**
```python
def analyze_logs_optimized(log_entries):
    # OPTIMIZATION 1: Direct hash lookup instead of iteration
    user_sessions = defaultdict(list)
    
    for entry in log_entries:  # O(n) - single pass
        session_key = create_session_key(entry)  # O(1) hash operation
        user_sessions[session_key].append(entry)  # O(1) append
    
    # OPTIMIZATION 2: Streaming analytics computation
    return streaming_analytics(user_sessions)  # O(n) single pass
```

**Expected Improvement:** 10,000x faster (10M² → 10M operations)

### Strategy 2: Memory-Efficient Streaming Processing
**Memory Reduction:** 32GB → <4GB
**Implementation:**
```python
def streaming_log_processor(log_file_path):
    session_tracker = SessionTracker(max_memory_mb=4000)
    
    # OPTIMIZATION 3: Process in chunks, don't load all data
    for log_chunk in read_log_chunks(log_file_path, chunk_size=100000):
        for entry in log_chunk:
            session_tracker.update_session(entry)
            
            # OPTIMIZATION 4: Flush completed sessions to reduce memory
            if session_tracker.memory_usage() > 3000:  # 3GB threshold
                session_tracker.flush_completed_sessions()
    
    return session_tracker.get_final_analytics()
```

### Strategy 3: Parallel Processing Implementation
**Speed Improvement:** 16x faster with 16-core utilization
**Implementation:**
```python
def parallel_log_analysis(log_file_path, n_workers=16):
    # OPTIMIZATION 5: Divide log file into parallel chunks
    log_chunks = partition_log_file(log_file_path, n_workers)
    
    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=n_workers) as executor:
        # Process chunks in parallel
        futures = [
            executor.submit(process_log_chunk, chunk) 
            for chunk in log_chunks
        ]
        
        # OPTIMIZATION 6: Merge results efficiently
        partial_results = [future.result() for future in futures]
        return merge_analytics_results(partial_results)
```

## 3. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Core Algorithm Optimization (Week 1)
**Hash-Based Session Mapping:**
```python
class OptimizedSessionTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_sessions = {}  # user_id -> session data
        self.session_timeout = 1800  # 30 minutes
        
    def process_entry(self, log_entry):
        user_id = log_entry.user_id
        timestamp = log_entry.timestamp
        
        # O(1) lookup instead of O(n) search
        if user_id in self.active_sessions:
            session = self.active_sessions[user_id]
            
            # Check if session expired
            if timestamp - session.last_activity > self.session_timeout:
                self.finalize_session(session)
                self.active_sessions[user_id] = self.create_new_session(log_entry)
            else:
                session.add_entry(log_entry)
        else:
            self.active_sessions[user_id] = self.create_new_session(log_entry)
```

### Phase 2: Memory Optimization (Week 2)
**Streaming Data Structures:**
```python
class MemoryEfficientAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, memory_limit_gb=8):
        self.memory_limit = memory_limit_gb * 1024**3
        self.running_analytics = RunningStats()
        
    def process_stream(self, log_stream):
        current_memory = 0
        
        for entry in log_stream:
            # Process entry immediately
            self.running_analytics.update(entry)
            current_memory += sys.getsizeof(entry)
            
            # OPTIMIZATION: Flush when approaching memory limit
            if current_memory > self.memory_limit * 0.8:
                self.flush_to_intermediate_storage()
                current_memory = 0
```

### Phase 3: Parallel Processing (Week 3)
**Multi-Core Utilization:**
- **Time-Based Partitioning:** Divide logs by timestamp ranges

        self.metrics = {
            'processing_rate': RateCounter(),
            'memory_usage': MemoryTracker(),
            'accuracy_score': AccuracyTracker()
        }
    
    def benchmark_optimization(self, test_dataset):
        start_time = time.time()
        peak_memory = 0
        
        result = optimized_algorithm.process(test_dataset)
        
        return {
            'execution_time': time.time() - start_time,
            'peak_memory': peak_memory,
            'throughput': len(test_dataset) / execution_time,
            'accuracy': self.validate_accuracy(result)
        }
```
