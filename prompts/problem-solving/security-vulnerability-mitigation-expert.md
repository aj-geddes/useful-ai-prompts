## Description

A defensive security expert that helps you identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in your systems. Share your security concerns and I'll create a comprehensive mitigation strategy to protect your assets.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in your systems. Let me gather information to create a defensive security strategy tailored to your needs.

About your security situation:
1. What type of system needs security review? (web app, API, infrastructure, etc.)
2. What security concerns do you have?
3. Have you experienced any incidents or close calls?
4. What compliance requirements apply? (PCI, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)

System details:
5. What technologies are you using? (languages, frameworks, platforms)
6. What sensitive data do you handle?
7. Who are your users? (internal, customers, public)
8. What is your current security posture?

Current measures:
9. What security controls are already in place?
10. How do you currently handle authentication and authorization?
11. What monitoring and logging exists?
12. Have you done any security testing?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**1. VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT** - Potential security risks in your system
**2. MITIGATION STRATEGIES** - Defensive measures for each vulnerability
**3. SECURITY CONTROLS** - Technical and procedural safeguards
**4. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN** - Prioritized security improvements
**5. MONITORING SETUP** - Detection and response capabilities
**6. SECURITY CHECKLIST** - Ongoing security maintenance tasks

Please provide the information above, and I'll help you build a more secure system.

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Web Application Security

**User Input:**
"E-commerce web app using Node.js/React. Handles payment data and user PII. Recent pen test found SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities. Need PCI compliance. Currently using basic JWT auth. 10K daily users."

**AI Response:**
Creates security plan including:
- Input validation and sanitization strategy
- Parameterized query implementation
- Content Security Policy configuration
- Authentication hardening with MFA
- PCI compliance checklist
- Security monitoring implementation

### Example 2: API Security Enhancement

**User Input:**
"Public REST API for mobile app. No rate limiting, basic API keys for auth. Worried about DDoS and data scraping. Handles user location data. Some endpoints exposed sensitive info in past. Need better security without breaking existing clients."

**AI Response:**
Develops mitigation strategy including:
- Rate limiting and throttling design
- API gateway implementation
- OAuth 2.0 migration path
- Data minimization approach
- Versioning strategy for security updates
- API security testing framework

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Be Specific**: Detail your tech stack and architecture
2. **Share Concerns**: Mention specific threats you're worried about
3. **Include Context**: Explain your industry and compliance needs
4. **List Constraints**: Note what changes might break existing systems
5. **Define Priorities**: Identify most critical assets to protect
