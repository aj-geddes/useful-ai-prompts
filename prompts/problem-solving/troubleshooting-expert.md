#### Database Performance Investigation

**Query Performance Analysis**:

**Problematic Queries Identified**:
```sql
-- Query 1: Customer Activity History (45.2 second execution)
SELECT c.*, ca.*, p.product_name, u.user_name 
FROM customers c 
JOIN customer_activities ca ON c.customer_id = ca.customer_id
JOIN products p ON ca.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN users u ON ca.user_id = u.user_id
WHERE c.created_date >= '2023-01-01'
ORDER BY ca.activity_date DESC;

-- Query 2: Sales Pipeline Report (38.7 second execution)
SELECT s.*, c.company_name, c.industry, u.user_name as sales_rep
FROM sales_opportunities s
JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN users u ON s.assigned_user_id = u.user_id
WHERE s.status IN ('prospecting', 'qualified', 'proposal')
AND s.created_date >= DATEADD(month, -6, GETDATE());
```

**Index Analysis Results**:
- **Missing Indexes**: 15 tables lacking proper indexing on frequently queried columns
- **Unused Indexes**: 23 indexes created but never used, consuming storage and update time
- **Fragmented Indexes**: 8 heavily fragmented indexes with >30% fragmentation
- **Statistics Outdated**: Query optimizer statistics not updated in 3+ months

#### Application Code Analysis

**Memory Leak Investigation**:

**Identified Issues**:
1. **User Session Objects**: Not properly cleaned up after user logout
2. **Database Connection Handling**: Connections not released in error scenarios
3. **Large Object Caching**: Customer activity data cached indefinitely
4. **Event Listeners**: JavaScript event listeners accumulating without cleanup

**Code Performance Bottlenecks**:
```java
// PROBLEMATIC CODE PATTERN IDENTIFIED
public List<Customer> getCustomerActivities(Long customerId) {
    // Issue 1: N+1 query problem
    List<Customer> customers = customerRepository.findAll();
    for (Customer customer : customers) {
        // Issue 2: Inefficient lazy loading
        customer.getActivities().size(); // Triggers separate query
        for (Activity activity : customer.getActivities()) {
            // Issue 3: Nested queries in loop
            activity.getUser().getName(); // Another separate query
        }
    }
    return customers;
}
```

CREATE INDEX idx_customer_activities_date_customer 
ON customer_activities (activity_date DESC, customer_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_customers_created_date 
ON customers (created_date);

-- Rewritten query with proper joins and filtering
SELECT c.customer_id, c.company_name, 
       ca.activity_date, ca.activity_type,
       p.product_name, u.user_name
FROM customers c 
INNER JOIN customer_activities ca ON c.customer_id = ca.customer_id
INNER JOIN products p ON ca.product_id = p.product_id
INNER JOIN users u ON ca.user_id = u.user_id
WHERE c.created_date >= '2023-01-01'
  AND ca.activity_date >= DATEADD(month, -3, GETDATE())
ORDER BY ca.activity_date DESC
LIMIT 1000;
```

**Application Code Optimization**:

**Resolved Memory Leak Issues**:
```java
// IMPROVED CODE WITH PROPER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
@Service
public class CustomerService {
    
    @Autowired
    private CustomerRepository customerRepository;
    
    @Transactional(readOnly = true)
    public List<CustomerActivityDTO> getCustomerActivities(Long customerId) {
        // Solution 1: Use efficient batch query
        List<CustomerActivity> activities = customerRepository
            .findActivitiesWithUserAndProductByCustomerId(customerId);
        
        // Solution 2: Use DTO projection to reduce memory usage
        return activities.stream()
            .map(this::mapToDTO)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
    
    // Solution 3: Proper resource cleanup
    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanup() {
        // Cleanup any cached resources
        cacheManager.evictAll();
    }
}
```
