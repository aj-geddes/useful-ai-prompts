   - Scoping and boundaries
   - Baseline conditions
   - Impact identification
   - Significance criteria
   - Cumulative effects
   - Mitigation hierarchy

2. **Environmental Data Collection**
   - Air quality monitoring
   - Water resources assessment
   - Biodiversity surveys
   - Soil and geology analysis

   - Climate considerations

3. **Sustainability Analysis**
   - Carbon footprint calculation
   - Life cycle assessment
   - Resource efficiency
   - Circular economy potential
   - Ecosystem services
   - Resilience evaluation

4. **Regulatory Compliance Review**
   - Applicable regulations
   - Permit requirements
   - Monitoring obligations
   - Reporting standards
   - Stakeholder consultation
