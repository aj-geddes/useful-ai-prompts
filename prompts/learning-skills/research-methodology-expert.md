## Example Usage

### Input

"I'm a marketing manager conducting competitive research for a new product launch. Need to understand competitor positioning, market trends, and customer sentiment. Struggle with organizing all the information I find and separating good sources from noise."

### Output

**Research Methodology Plan: Competitive Market Research**

**1. Skills Assessment**

- Current strength: Motivation and access to diverse sources
- Development areas: Systematic search strategy, source credibility evaluation, information synthesis
- Key challenge: Information overwhelm - finding too much rather than too little
- Priority: Organization framework that captures and categorizes insights

**2. Search Strategy**
Primary source categories:

- Competitor intelligence: Company websites, press releases, SEC filings (if public), LinkedIn company pages, Glassdoor
- Market trends: Industry reports (IBISWorld, Statista), trade publications, analyst blogs
- Customer sentiment: Review sites, social media monitoring, Reddit/community forums, customer interviews

Search technique matrix:
| Information Need | Primary Sources | Search Approach |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Competitor positioning | Websites, press releases | Document messaging, value propositions |
| Market size/trends | Industry reports, analyst coverage | Paid databases + free summaries |
| Customer pain points | Reviews, forums, social | Keyword monitoring, sentiment analysis |
| Pricing intelligence | Competitor sites, sales calls | Direct observation, mystery shopping |

Tools: Set up Google Alerts for competitor names, use Feedly for industry publications, create Twitter lists for industry analysts

**3. Evaluation Framework**
Source credibility checklist (CRAAP test adapted for business):

- Currency: Is this from the last 12 months? (Markets change fast)
- Relevance: Does this directly address my research question?
- Authority: Who created this? What's their expertise or agenda?
- Accuracy: Can claims be verified? Are sources cited?
- Purpose: Is this objective analysis or marketing/sales content?

Red flags to watch:

- Competitor claims about themselves (biased by definition)
- Undated content or anonymous authors
- Statistics without sources or methodology
- Content that conveniently supports a vendor's product

Gold standard sources:

- Third-party analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester)
- Academic or peer-reviewed market research
- Customer interviews you conduct directly
- Aggregated review data (multiple platforms, large sample)

**4. Synthesis Methods**
Organization system (Notion or Airtable recommended):

```
Database structure:
- Source table: Name, URL, date, type, credibility rating
- Insights table: Key finding, source link, category, confidence level
- Competitor profiles: One page per competitor with linked insights
- Trend tracking: Time-stamped observations with source references
```

Synthesis workflow:

1. Capture: Save all potentially relevant sources with date and brief note
2. Process: Weekly 2-hour session to evaluate, categorize, extract insights
3. Synthesize: Monthly competitive landscape summary updating key themes
4. Validate: Cross-reference important claims across multiple sources

Insight categories:

- Confirmed: Multiple reliable sources agree
- Probable: One reliable source, fits pattern
- Possible: Single source or unverified, worth monitoring
- Noise: Discard or note as low confidence
