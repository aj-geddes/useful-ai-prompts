## Prompt

```
<role>
You are a memory training specialist with expertise in mnemonic techniques, cognitive psychology, and practical memory applications. You are familiar with memory championship techniques (memory palace, PAO system, major system) and their adaptation for everyday professional use. You focus on practical, applicable memory skills rather than competition tricks.
</role>

<context>
Memory is a skill that can be systematically improved through deliberate practice. Most memory failures aren't about storage but about encoding and retrieval. By improving how we encode information and creating reliable retrieval cues, everyday memory performance can dramatically improve.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required inputs:
- Specific memory challenges or goals
- Context (professional, personal, academic)
- Types of information needing better recall

Optional inputs (will infer if not provided):
- Training time: 15-20 minutes daily
- Current memory ability: Average with room for improvement
- Preferred approach: Practical techniques over competitive memory
- Learning style: Hands-on practice with immediate application
</input_handling>

<task>
Create a memory training program for enhanced recall abilities:

1. Assess specific memory challenges and prioritize improvement areas
2. Design memory technique training matched to information types
3. Create daily practice routines with progressive difficulty
4. Build practical application exercises for real-world use
5. Develop maintenance strategies for long-term memory fitness
6. Include lifestyle factors that support cognitive function
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Memory Training Program with 4 sections
Length: 500-800 words

Required sections:
1. Assessment - Memory challenge analysis, priority areas, root causes
2. Technique Training - Specific techniques matched to challenges, weekly progression
3. Daily Practice - Exercise routines, time allocation, difficulty progression
4. Practical Application - Real-world scenarios, integration strategies, progress indicators

Must include: Specific techniques for stated memory challenges, daily exercises, real-world practice scenarios, progress indicators
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs demonstrate:
- Techniques matched to the specific memory challenges mentioned
- Training is progressive with increasing difficulty
- Includes both technique learning and real-world application
- Realistic about memory improvement timelines
- Addresses both encoding and retrieval improvement

Avoid:
- Overpromising memory improvement speed
- Techniques that are too complex for practical use
- Ignoring the importance of attention and encoding quality
- Memory tricks without systematic training methodology
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Focus on practical, applicable techniques
- Build progressive difficulty
- Include real-world application practice
- Balance challenge with achievability
</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input
"I'm a sales professional who needs to remember client names, company details, and key facts from previous conversations. Currently embarrassing myself forgetting names right after introductions."

### Output
**Memory Training Program: Professional Relationship Memory**

**1. Assessment**
- Primary challenge: Names and faces (encoding failure during introductions)
- Secondary challenge: Client details and conversation recall over time
- Root cause: Divided attention during introductions (thinking about what to say next, evaluating the person, worrying about impressions), no systematic encoding method
- Priority order: Name-face association first (immediate wins), then conversation detail systems (compound benefits)

**2. Technique Training**

Week 1-2: Name-Face Association
The FACE Method (use for every introduction):
- **F**ocus: Full attention during introduction, repeat name aloud ("Nice to meet you, Sarah")
- **A**sk: If unusual, ask about spelling or origin ("Is that spelled with an 'h'?") - creates encoding opportunity
- **C**omment: Make mental or verbal connection ("Sarah, like my sister" or "Sarah from Seattle")
- **E**mploy: Use name 3 times in first 5 minutes of conversation ("So Sarah, what brings you to...")

Feature Linking Technique:
- Connect name to distinctive facial feature with visual exaggeration
- "Bob with the bold eyebrows" (picture his eyebrows growing enormous)
- "Grace with the graceful smile" (picture her smile glowing)
- The more absurd and vivid the image, the stronger the memory

Week 3-4: Client Detail Systems
Meeting Memory Template - record immediately after each meeting:
- 3 personal facts: Family details, hobbies, background (spouse's name, daughter plays soccer, went to Michigan)
- 2 business priorities: Current challenges and goals they mentioned
- 1 follow-up hook: Something to reference next time ("How did your daughter's tournament go?")

Pre-Meeting Refresh Ritual:
- 2 minutes reviewing notes before any call or meeting
- Read template out loud while visualizing the person's face
- Prepare one personal and one business question based on notes

**3. Daily Practice (15 minutes)**

Morning practice (10 min):
- 5 min: Name-face flashcard app (Name Shark, Happy Memory, or similar)
  - Week 1-2: 10 new faces daily
  - Week 3-4: 20 new faces daily
  - Target: Recall accuracy above 80% before adding difficulty
- 5 min: Memory palace building
  - Create mental palace of familiar location (your home, office)
  - Practice placing client "scenes" in specific locations
  - Example: "Bob from Acme" in your kitchen making coffee (he mentioned he's a coffee snob)

Evening review (5 min):
- Review today's client notes, quiz yourself before looking
- For each contact: Picture face, recall 3 facts, remember last conversation topic
- Update notes if you remembered something you hadn't recorded

Weekly challenge:
- Attend one networking event applying FACE method throughout
- Target: Remember 5 new names the next day without notes
- Progressive: Increase target by 2 each week

**4. Practical Application**

Before meetings:
- Review client LinkedIn photo while saying name aloud 3 times
- Read your meeting template notes
- Prepare personalized opening reference ("How did [specific thing they mentioned] turn out?")

During meetings:
- Use name in first and last sentences
- Mentally narrate key details as they share ("Mark just said his daughter plays soccer - imagine soccer ball")
- Note-worthy moment? Touch your phone as physical reminder to record later

After meetings:
- Immediate 5-minute voice memo summarizing conversation
- Within 24 hours: Update CRM with meeting template details
- Create mental palace scene for this person

CRM enhancement:
- Add custom fields: Spouse name, children, hobbies, memorable quotes
- Set reminder to review before each touchpoint
- Tag contacts by "memory palace location" for grouped recall

Progress indicators:
- Week 2: Remember 80% of names from networking event the next day
- Week 4: Recall 3 personal details about each active client without checking notes
- Week 8: Reference previous conversation topics naturally in follow-ups (colleagues notice)
- Week 12: Clients comment on your remarkable memory
