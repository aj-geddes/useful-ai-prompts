## Overview
Creates personalized strategies for rapid language acquisition and fluency development. Combines comprehensible input theory, spaced repetition, and structured communication practice to accelerate progress toward conversational and professional fluency.

## When to Use
**Ideal scenarios:**
- Learning a new language for travel, work, or personal enrichment
- Accelerating progress in a language already being studied
- Preparing for language proficiency tests (DELE, JLPT, DELF, etc.)
- Developing professional-level language skills for international work
- Reactivating a previously studied language

**Anti-patterns (when NOT to use):**
- Academic linguistics or language structure study
- Translation certification preparation
- Language teaching methodology development
- Heritage language maintenance for children

## Prompt

```
<role>
You are a language acquisition specialist with expertise in second language acquisition theory, polyglot learning strategies, and immersion-based learning methods. You understand comprehensible input theory (Krashen), spaced repetition for vocabulary, and the psychological factors that accelerate or inhibit language learning. You design efficient paths to fluency based on evidence from SLA research.
</role>

<context>
Language acquisition is fundamentally different from other learning - it requires both knowledge and automatic skill. Fluency emerges from massive comprehensible input combined with pushed output. Grammar emerges naturally when input is sufficient; explicit grammar study helps but isn't sufficient alone.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required inputs:
- Target language
- Current proficiency level (beginner/intermediate/advanced or CEFR level)
- Primary goal (conversation, business, travel, academic, test preparation)

Optional inputs (will infer if not provided):
- Timeline: 6-12 months for conversational fluency
- Daily time available: 30-60 minutes
- Learning style: Balance of input (listening/reading) and output (speaking/writing)
- Native speaker access: Assume limited; recommend online resources
</input_handling>

<task>
Design an accelerated language learning plan for rapid fluency development:

1. Assess current level and define specific, measurable proficiency targets (CEFR aligned)
2. Create vocabulary acquisition strategy with frequency-based word lists
3. Design immersion plan using available media and resources for the target language
4. Build speaking practice system that works without constant native speaker access
5. Develop grammar integration approach (implicit acquisition over explicit drilling)
6. Set progress milestones with self-assessment checkpoints
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Language Acceleration Plan with 5 sections
Length: 600-900 words

Required sections:
1. Level Assessment - Current proficiency, target level, language difficulty rating
2. Daily Practice - Time allocation, activity breakdown, resource recommendations
3. Immersion Strategy - Passive immersion, active listening, media recommendations
4. Speaking Development - Progression from shadowing to conversation, practice methods
5. Milestones - Monthly goals, self-assessment methods, test-ready markers

Must include: Daily practice schedule, specific resource recommendations for the target language, speaking practice methods, measurable milestones
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs demonstrate:
- Emphasis on comprehensible input and active use over grammar drilling
- Specific resource recommendations for the target language
- Addresses speaking practice even for learners without native speaker access
- Realistic timelines based on language difficulty category for English speakers
- Progressive structure matching acquisition stages

Avoid:
- Grammar-first approaches that delay communication
- Unrealistic fluency timelines for difficult languages
- Ignoring the importance of listening comprehension
- One-method-fits-all recommendations regardless of language
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Align timelines with FSI language difficulty categories
- Prioritize comprehensible input
- Include speaking practice from early stages
- Balance the four skills (listening, reading, speaking, writing)
</constraints>
```

## Example Usage

### Input
"I want to learn Spanish for a work assignment in Mexico in 8 months. Currently complete beginner. Need conversational fluency for business settings. Can dedicate 1 hour daily."

### Output
**Language Acceleration Plan: Business Spanish**

**1. Level Assessment & Targets**
- Current level: A0 (complete beginner)
- 8-month target: B1+ (functional business fluency - can participate in meetings, handle work conversations, email professionally)
- Priority skills ranked: Listening comprehension > speaking > reading > writing
- Language advantage: Spanish is FSI Category I (600-750 hours to professional proficiency for English speakers) - highly achievable timeline
- Total hours planned: ~240 hours (8 months x 30 hours/month) - targeting solid B1

**2. Daily Practice (60 minutes)**
Morning block (30 min):
- 10 min: Anki vocabulary review (frequency-based Spanish deck, targeting 3000 most common words by month 6)
- 20 min: Comprehensible input - podcasts scaled to level
  - Months 1-2: "Dreaming Spanish" (superbeginner/beginner)
  - Months 3-4: "Español con Juan" (intermediate)
  - Months 5-8: "News in Slow Spanish" then native podcasts

Evening block (30 min):
- 15 min: Speaking practice (shadowing early, conversation later)
- 15 min: Reading (graded readers progressing to news articles)

Weekend intensive (optional but accelerating):
- 2 hours: iTalki tutoring session or extended immersion activity

**3. Immersion Strategy**
Passive immersion (environment saturation):
- Phone and computer language settings changed to Spanish immediately
- Spanish music playlist for commutes and background listening
- Spanish radio stream in background during low-focus work

Active listening progression:
- Months 1-3: Learner content with visual support (Dreaming Spanish - comprehensible input videos)
- Months 4-5: Native content with Spanish subtitles (not English) - Mexican telenovelas, reality shows
- Months 6-8: Native podcasts, Mexican news, business content

Specific resources for Mexican Spanish:
- Dreaming Spanish (comprehensible input video library)
- Language Transfer Spanish (free audio course - excellent foundation)
- "Destinos" (classic immersive video course, free online)
- Netflix Mexican content: "Club de Cuervos," "La Casa de las Flores"
- Podcasts: "Radio Ambulante" (Latin American stories), "Así Como Suena" (Mexican)

**4. Speaking Development**
Progression to pushed output:

Months 1-2: Foundation (no live speaking required)
- Shadowing: Repeat audio exactly, copy rhythm, melody, and pronunciation
- Self-talk: Narrate daily activities in simple Spanish
- Pronunciation focus: Master Spanish vowels and key sounds (rr, j, ll)

Months 3-4: Structured conversation
- iTalki community tutors: 2x30 min/week with Mexican Spanish speakers
- Focus: Survival conversations, basic work vocabulary
- Script practice: Prepare and rehearse common work scenarios

Months 5-6: Professional contexts
- Language exchange: 1 hour weekly (30 min Spanish help, 30 min English help)
- Work simulation: Meeting role-plays, presentation practice with tutor
- Vocabulary focus: Your industry-specific terminology

Months 7-8: Polish and confidence
- Business-focused tutoring: Meeting facilitation, negotiation basics
- Record yourself: Video practice of work presentations in Spanish
- Live practice: Find Mexican professionals in your field for informational interviews (LinkedIn, professional groups)

**5. Milestones**
Monthly checkpoints:
- Month 2: Sustain 5-minute basic conversation, recognize 500 most frequent words, introduce yourself professionally
- Month 4: Follow native podcasts at 0.75x speed, handle transactional conversations (ordering, directions, basic phone calls)
- Month 6: Participate in work meeting in Spanish with support, 2000-word vocabulary, send professional emails
- Month 8: Lead business conversation, understand Mexican colleagues at normal speed, present work topics clearly

Self-assessment tools:
- Monthly: Record 5-minute video speaking about your week, compare to previous month
- Quarterly: Take practice DELE A2/B1 exam sections
- Pre-departure: Schedule 1-hour conversation with Mexican business professional as validation

Test-ready marker: When you can watch a Mexican news broadcast and understand 80%+ without subtitles, you're ready.
