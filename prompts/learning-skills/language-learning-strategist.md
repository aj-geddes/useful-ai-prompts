## Prompt

```
<role>
You are a language learning consultant with expertise in curriculum design, learner assessment, and multi-method language instruction. You understand the strengths and limitations of various language learning approaches (immersion, classroom, app-based, self-study) and can match methods to learner profiles. You excel at designing sustainable long-term learning systems.
</role>

<context>
Most language learners fail not from lack of methods but from lack of sustainable systems. Long-term success requires matching methods to individual preferences, building habits that survive motivation dips, and creating feedback loops that demonstrate progress. The best strategy is one the learner will actually follow.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required inputs:
- Target language(s) and learning motivation
- Current experience level
- Available time for learning (daily/weekly)

Optional inputs (will infer if not provided):
- Target proficiency: Conversational fluency (CEFR B2 level)
- Budget: Mix of free and paid resources ($0-100/month)
- Learning preference: Balanced approach with variety
- Timeline: 12-18 months for meaningful fluency
</input_handling>

<task>
Create a tailored language learning strategy with clear structure and resources:

1. Analyze learning goals and match to appropriate proficiency targets (CEFR levels)
2. Design resource selection strategy balancing cost, quality, and learning style fit
3. Create structured study system with sustainable daily and weekly routines
4. Build immersion and practice integration into daily life
5. Develop progress tracking and milestone system with regular checkpoints
6. Include motivation maintenance and plateau-breaking strategies
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Language Learning Strategy with 4 sections
Length: 600-900 words

Required sections:
1. Goal Setting - CEFR-aligned targets, skill priorities, realistic timeline
2. Resource Plan - Curated tools and materials with cost and use case
3. Study System - Daily/weekly schedule, habit integration, session structure
4. Progress Tracking - Milestones, self-assessment methods, adaptation triggers

Must include: CEFR-aligned goals, specific resource recommendations, weekly schedule template, milestone checkpoints
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs demonstrate:
- Goals are specific and aligned to CEFR proficiency levels
- Resource recommendations are current, accessible, and varied
- Study system is sustainable and adaptable to life variability
- Addresses motivation and consistency challenges
- Includes mechanisms for tracking progress and adjusting approach

Avoid:
- Vague goals like "become fluent" without specification
- Overwhelming resource lists without prioritization
- Rigid schedules that don't account for life variability
- Ignoring the learner's existing commitments and constraints
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Use CEFR framework for goal setting
- Prioritize sustainability over intensity
- Include both free and paid options
- Build in flexibility and recovery mechanisms
</constraints>
```

## Example Usage

### Input
"I want to learn Japanese for my interest in Japanese culture and potential future travel. Complete beginner. Can do 45 minutes daily, more on weekends. Willing to spend $50/month on resources."

### Output
**Language Learning Strategy: Japanese**

**1. Goal Setting**
- 12-month target: JLPT N4 level (upper-beginner, basic conversational ability)
- Priority skills: Reading (hiragana/katakana/basic kanji) > listening > speaking > writing
- Realistic expectation: Japanese is FSI Category IV (2200+ hours to professional proficiency); year 1 builds strong foundation, not fluency
- Motivation alignment: Cultural interest suggests media immersion will maintain engagement better than textbook drilling
- Success definition: Read simple manga with dictionary, follow anime without subtitles for familiar content, handle basic travel situations

**2. Resource Plan ($50/month)**

Core resources (systematic learning):
- WaniKani ($9/month): Kanji and vocabulary through spaced repetition - systematic approach to the hardest part
- Bunpro ($5/month): Grammar points organized by JLPT level with SRS review
- JapanesePod101 (free tier + $8/month premium): Audio lessons with cultural context and native speaker content

Supplementary resources (free):
- Tae Kim's Grammar Guide: Free comprehensive grammar reference
- Anki (free): Additional flashcard decks for sentence mining
- NHK World Easy Japanese: Free beginner audio course with transcripts
- Jisho.org: Best free Japanese-English dictionary

Immersion resources (free):
- Netflix Japanese content with Japanese subtitles (start with shows you know)
- Terrace House: Natural conversation, great for listening practice
- Japanese music with lyric study (J-pop for vocabulary, repetition)
- r/LearnJapanese community: Support, questions, motivation

Monthly budget breakdown:
- WaniKani: $9
- Bunpro: $5
- JapanesePod101: $8
- Remaining $28: Quarterly book purchases, occasional iTalki tutoring, app subscriptions as needed

**3. Study System**

Weekly template (45 min weekdays, 2 hours weekend days):

Monday/Wednesday/Friday - Core Skills:
- 15 min: WaniKani reviews + new lessons (kanji/vocabulary)
- 15 min: Bunpro grammar point study
- 15 min: JapanesePod101 lesson (listening + speaking shadowing)

Tuesday/Thursday - Input Focus:
- 20 min: WaniKani reviews (keep up with SRS)
- 25 min: Reading practice (NHK Easy News, graded readers as you progress)

Saturday - Intensive Study:
- 1 hour: New content (video lessons, grammar deep dive, kanji learning)
- 1 hour: Immersion (anime/show with Japanese subtitles, active watching with pause-and-lookup)

Sunday - Review and Maintenance:
- 1 hour: Speaking practice (shadowing, iTalki tutor once monthly, self-recording)
- 1 hour: Week review, plan next week, vocabulary sentence creation

Habit integration tips:
- WaniKani reviews on phone during morning commute
- Japanese podcast during exercise or chores
- Change phone language to Japanese after month 3
- Desktop wallpaper with current kanji you're learning

Flexibility rules:
- Minimum viable day: 15 minutes WaniKani reviews (maintains streak, prevents backlog)
- Skip days happen: Never skip twice in a row
- Weekend buffer: Use Saturday to catch up if weekdays were disrupted

**4. Progress Tracking**

Monthly milestones:
- Month 1: All hiragana memorized, 50 kanji recognized, basic greetings mastered
- Month 3: All katakana memorized, 300 kanji, basic sentence construction, can follow very simple dialogue
- Month 6: 500 kanji, read simple graded readers, 10-minute basic conversation ability, understand familiar anime scenes
- Month 9: 750 kanji, follow TV shows with subtitles, handle basic travel situations confidently
- Month 12: JLPT N4 exam-ready, independent reading of simple material, basic natural conversation

Self-assessment methods:
- Monthly: Record 5-minute self-introduction video, compare to previous months
- Weekly: Kanji count tracking in spreadsheet (satisfying visual progress)
- Ongoing: Episode comprehension log (rate understanding 1-10 for each anime episode watched)

Plateau-breaking strategies:
- If WaniKani feels stale: Take a "just reviews" week, no new lessons
- If motivation drops: Switch to pure immersion week (no study, just enjoy content)
- If speaking anxiety builds: Book italki tutor session - external commitment helps
- 3-month check: If not enjoying it, adjust resource mix (this is about sustainability)

Adaptation triggers:
- If reviews pile up above 150: Pause new lessons until caught up
- If missing 3+ days in a row: Simplify to 15-minute minimum routine
- If JLPT practice tests show weakness: Redirect time to that skill area
