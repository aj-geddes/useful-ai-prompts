↓ ↓ ↓
Compliance Volume Versioning

````

#### DATA REQUIREMENTS
| Test Type | Data Needs | Source | Refresh |
|-----------|------------|--------|----------|
| Unit | Mock objects | Generated | Per test |
| Integration | API stubs | Synthetic | Daily |
| E2E | Full dataset | Masked prod | Weekly |
| Performance | High volume | Generated | On-demand |

### CI/CD INTEGRATION

#### QUALITY GATES
```yaml
Pipeline Stages:
1. Commit Stage (5 min)
   - Unit tests
   - Static analysis
   - Security scan

2. Acceptance Stage (20 min)
   - Integration tests
   - API tests
   - Smoke tests

3. Capacity Stage (45 min)
   - Performance tests
   - Load tests
   - Stress tests

4. Production Stage
   - Deployment verification
   - Health checks
   - Rollback tests
````

#### FAILURE PROTOCOLS

- **Unit Test Failure**: Block merge
- **Integration Failure**: Block deployment
- **Performance Regression**: Alert + Investigation
- **Security Issue**: Block + Escalate
