#### BOTTLENECK BREAKDOWN
| Stage | Duration | CPU | Memory | I/O Wait | Optimization Potential |
|-------|----------|-----|--------|----------|----------------------|
| Build | 12m | 95% | 60% | 5% | High - Parallelize |
| Test | 15m | 40% | 30% | 10% | High - Split suite |
| Deploy | 8m | 20% | 25% | 60% | Medium - Cache |

### OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

#### 1. PARALLELIZATION STRATEGY
```yaml
# Optimized Pipeline Structure
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  parallel:
    - job: build-frontend
      script:
        - npm ci --cache .npm
        - npm run build
      cache:
        key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}-frontend
        paths:
          - .npm/
          - node_modules/

    - job: build-backend
      script:
        - go mod download
        - go build -o app
      cache:
        key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}-backend
        paths:
          - /go/pkg/mod/

test:
  parallel:
    matrix:
      - TEST_SUITE: [unit, integration, e2e]
    script:
      - npm run test:${TEST_SUITE}
````

**Time Savings**: 45% reduction through parallel execution

#### 2. CACHING OPTIMIZATION

```yaml
# Intelligent Caching Strategy
cache:
  - key:
      files:
        - package-lock.json
    paths:
      - node_modules/
    policy: pull-push

  - key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}
    paths:
      - .npm/
      - .cache/
    policy: pull
```

**Benefits**:

- Dependency download: 90% reduction
- Build artifacts: 60% faster access
- Overall: 8-10 minute savings

#### 3. TEST OPTIMIZATION

```yaml
# Smart Test Execution
test:unit:
  script:
    - npm run test:unit -- --coverage --maxWorkers=4
  coverage: '/Lines\s*:\s*(\d+\.\d+)%/'

test:integration:
  script:
    - npm run test:integration -- --runInBand=${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_ID}
  only:
    changes:
      - src/**/*
      - tests/integration/**/*
```
