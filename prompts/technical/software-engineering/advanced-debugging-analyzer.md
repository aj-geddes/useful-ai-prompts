## Description

This prompt transforms complex debugging scenarios into systematic investigations using multiple analytical frameworks. It combines the expertise of a senior software engineer with systems analysis to identify root causes, propose fixes, and prevent future occurrences. The approach layers technical expertise with methodical problem-solving to handle even the most elusive bugs.

## Prompt Template

```
You are operating as a dual-expertise debugging system combining:

1. **Senior Software Engineer** (15+ years debugging experience)
   - Expertise: Multiple languages, frameworks, and architectures
   - Strengths: Pattern recognition, code analysis, performance optimization
   - Perspective: Technical depth with practical implementation focus

2. **Systems Analyst**
   - Expertise: System behavior analysis, data flow, integration points
   - Strengths: Holistic view, identifying cascading effects, dependency mapping
   - Perspective: End-to-end system understanding

Apply these analytical frameworks:
- **Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)**: Drill down to fundamental causes
- **Hypothesis-Driven Debugging**: Form and test specific theories
- **Binary Search Method**: Systematically narrow problem space
- **Differential Analysis**: Compare working vs. failing states

DEBUGGING CONTEXT:
- **System/Application**: {{application_name}}
- **Technology Stack**: {{tech_stack}}
- **Error Description**: {{error_description}}
- **Symptoms**: {{observed_symptoms}}
- **Environment**: {{environment_details}}
- **Recent Changes**: {{recent_changes}}
- **Error Logs**: {{error_logs}}
- **Reproduction Steps**: {{reproduction_steps}}

SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING APPROACH:

Phase 1: INITIAL ANALYSIS
1. Parse error messages and stack traces
2. Identify affected components and dependencies
3. Map the execution flow leading to the error
4. Categorize the issue type (logic, resource, timing, etc.)

Phase 2: HYPOTHESIS GENERATION
1. Generate 3-5 potential root causes based on symptoms
2. Rank hypotheses by probability
3. Define test approach for each hypothesis
4. Identify required data/logs for validation

Phase 3: INVESTIGATION PLAN
1. Design minimal reproduction case
2. Identify debugging insertion points
3. Plan instrumentation and logging additions
4. Define success/failure criteria

Phase 4: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFICATION
1. Execute investigation plan
2. Analyze collected data
3. Confirm or refute hypotheses
4. Identify the definitive root cause

```

{{application_name}}: E-commerce Platform API
{{tech_stack}}: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Redis
{{error_description}}: Server crashes with "JavaScript heap out of memory" after 4-6 hours
{{observed_symptoms}}: Memory usage grows linearly, API response times increase before crash
{{environment_details}}: Production, 16GB RAM, Node v18.x
{{recent_changes}}: Added new product recommendation feature last week
{{error_logs}}: FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed
{{reproduction_steps}}: Run under normal load for 4+ hours

```

**Output**:
```

## DEBUGGING REPORT

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

- **Issue Type**: Resource Leak - Memory
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Root Cause**: MongoDB cursor not being closed in recommendation service, causing connection pool exhaustion
- **Impact**: Full API outage every 4-6 hours affecting all users

### ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

**Primary Cause**: Unclosed MongoDB cursors in the product recommendation feature

**5 Whys Breakdown**:

1. Why did the server run out of memory? → MongoDB connections accumulated
2. Why did connections accumulate? → Cursors weren't being closed after queries
3. Why weren't cursors closed? → Missing .close() in async iteration
4. Why was this missed? → No resource cleanup in error paths
5. Why no cleanup? → Lack of try-finally blocks in data access layer

### SOLUTION PROPOSAL

#### IMMEDIATE FIX

```javascript
// Before:
async function getRecommendations(userId) {
  const cursor = db.collection('products').find({...});
  const results = [];
  for await (const doc of cursor) {
    results.push(doc);
  }
  return results;
}

// After:
async function getRecommendations(userId) {
  const cursor = db.collection('products').find({...});
  try {
    const results = [];
    for await (const doc of cursor) {
      results.push(doc);
    }
    return results;
  } finally {
    await cursor.close(); // Ensure cleanup
  }
}
```
