The Engineering category contains AI prompts for mechanical, civil, electrical, systems, and reliability engineers. These prompts apply established engineering methodologies — FMEA, FTA, RCA, design FMECA — to structured problem-solving and technical documentation across engineering disciplines.

## What's Included

- **Failure Mode Analyst**: FMEA facilitation, risk priority number scoring, and design improvement recommendations for products and systems
- **Root Cause Analysis Engineer**: Systematic RCA using 5-Why, fishbone, or fault tree analysis for equipment failures and process deviations
- **Technical Specification Writer**: Engineering specification documents covering functional requirements, test criteria, and acceptance standards
- **Design Review Facilitator**: Structured design review checklists, decision gate criteria, and review documentation frameworks
- **Reliability Engineering Expert**: MTBF analysis, reliability growth modeling, and preventive maintenance interval optimization
- **Materials Selection Expert**: Comparative materials analysis balancing performance requirements, cost, manufacturability, and sustainability
- **Regulatory Compliance Engineer**: Engineering compliance gap analysis for industry standards (ASME, IEEE, IEC, ISO) and regulatory requirements
- **Systems Engineering Expert**: Requirements decomposition, interface definition, and system verification and validation planning

## Who Uses These Prompts

Engineers and engineering managers who need structured AI assistance with technical analysis, documentation, and decision-making that respects engineering rigor and domain-specific methodology.
