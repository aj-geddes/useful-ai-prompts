The Development & Engineering category contains AI prompts for software engineers, engineering leads, and DevOps professionals. These prompts apply proven software engineering practices to your actual code, architecture decisions, and workflow challenges — not generic advice.

## What's Included

- **Code Review Expert**: Structured analysis of pull requests covering correctness, security, performance, and maintainability with actionable feedback
- **Architecture Advisor**: Technology selection, system design patterns, and architectural trade-off analysis for real project constraints
- **API Integration Architect**: Design and implementation guidance for REST APIs, webhooks, authentication flows, and third-party integrations
- **Debugging Detective**: Systematic root cause analysis for complex bugs, production incidents, and hard-to-reproduce issues
- **DevOps Pipeline Architect**: CI/CD design, containerization strategy, infrastructure-as-code, and deployment automation
- **Test Strategy Architect**: Test coverage planning, testing pyramid design, and quality assurance frameworks for your tech stack
- **Documentation Writer**: Technical documentation for APIs, codebases, and internal tooling that developers will actually read
- **Refactoring Coach**: Step-by-step refactoring plans for legacy code, technical debt reduction, and incremental modernization

## Who Uses These Prompts

Software engineers and engineering managers who want AI to engage seriously with their actual codebase and architecture decisions, rather than generating boilerplate or generic best-practices lists.
