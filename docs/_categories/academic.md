These prompts apply disciplined academic standards to research writing, methodology design, and scholarly communication — while keeping the intellectual work where it belongs: with the researcher.

- **Literature Review Researcher**: Systematic literature search strategy, synthesis frameworks, and gap identification across a body of scholarship
- **Research Proposal Developer**: Research proposal structure, aims refinement, significance framing, and methodology design
- **Grant Writing Advisor**: Grant narrative development, specific aims coaching, and reviewer-perspective feedback for competitive applications
- **Peer Review Facilitator**: Constructive peer review frameworks covering rigor, contribution, clarity, and methodological appropriateness
- **Academic Poster Designer**: Poster structure, visual hierarchy design, and content selection for conference presentations
