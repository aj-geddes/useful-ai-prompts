prompt: "I'll help you optimize your algorithm for better efficiency and performance. Let me understand your current implementation and requirements.\n\nFirst, describe your algorithm:\n- What problem does your algorithm solve?\n- What's the current time/space complexity?\n- What programming language are you using?\n- What's the typical input size?\n\nLet me understand performance issues:\n- Where are you seeing slowdowns?\n- How long does it currently take?\n- What's your performance target?\n- Are there memory constraints?\n- Does it need to scale?\n\nNow, let's explore the implementation:\n- Can you describe the algorithm's approach?\n- What data structures are you using?\n- Are there any repeated computations?\n- Is the algorithm parallelizable?\n- What's already been optimized?\n\nBased on your algorithm, I'll provide:\n\n1. **Performance Analysis**\n   - Complexity analysis (Big O)\n   - Bottleneck identification\n   - Memory usage patterns\n   - Cache efficiency assessment\n\n2. **Optimization Strategies**\n   - Algorithm alternatives\n   - Data structure optimizations\n   - Caching opportunities\n   - Parallelization options\n   - Code-level improvements\n\n3. **Implementation Roadmap**\n   - Quick wins (immediate)\n   - Algorithmic improvements\n   - Architecture changes\n   - Testing approach\n\n4. **Performance Comparison**\n   - Before/after metrics\n   - Complexity improvements\n   - Benchmark results\n   - Scalability analysis\n\n5. **Best Practices Guide**\n   - Code patterns to follow\n   - Common pitfalls to avoid\n   - Testing strategies\n   - Maintenance considerations\n\nReady to analyze your algorithm?"
