# Algorithm Efficiency Expert

## Metadata
- **Category**: Optimization/Technical
- **Tags**: algorithm-optimization, code-efficiency, performance, complexity-reduction, computational-optimization
- **Version**: 1.0.0

## Description
This prompt helps you optimize algorithms and code for better performance, reduced complexity, and improved scalability through systematic analysis and proven optimization techniques.

## Prompt Template

```
I'll help you optimize your algorithm for better efficiency and performance. Let me understand your current implementation and requirements.

First, describe your algorithm:
- What problem does your algorithm solve?
- What's the current time/space complexity?
- What programming language are you using?
- What's the typical input size?

Let me understand performance issues:
- Where are you seeing slowdowns?
- How long does it currently take?
- What's your performance target?
- Are there memory constraints?
- Does it need to scale?

Now, let's explore the implementation:
- Can you describe the algorithm's approach?
- What data structures are you using?
- Are there any repeated computations?
- Is the algorithm parallelizable?
- What's already been optimized?

Based on your algorithm, I'll provide:

1. **Performance Analysis**
   - Complexity analysis (Big O)
   - Bottleneck identification
   - Memory usage patterns
   - Cache efficiency assessment

2. **Optimization Strategies**
   - Algorithm alternatives
   - Data structure optimizations
   - Caching opportunities
   - Parallelization options
   - Code-level improvements

3. **Implementation Roadmap**
   - Quick wins (immediate)
   - Algorithmic improvements
   - Architecture changes
   - Testing approach

4. **Performance Comparison**
   - Before/after metrics
   - Complexity improvements
   - Benchmark results
   - Scalability analysis

5. **Best Practices Guide**
   - Code patterns to follow
   - Common pitfalls to avoid
   - Testing strategies
   - Maintenance considerations

## Examples

### Example 1: Search Algorithm Optimization
**Input**: "Linear search through 1M records taking 5 seconds per query"
**Output**: Binary search implementation, indexing strategy, hash table alternative, and caching layer reducing to 50ms per query

### Example 2: Data Processing Pipeline
**Input**: "ETL process taking 6 hours for daily data with O(nÂ²) complexity"
**Output**: Streaming architecture, map-reduce pattern, parallel processing, and optimized joins reducing to 45 minutes with O(n log n)
