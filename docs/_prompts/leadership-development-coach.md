Leadership is a learnable skill, not an innate trait. Effective development follows the 70-20-10 model: 70% on-the-job experience, 20% learning from others, 10% formal training. The transition from individual contributor to leader requires fundamental mindset shifts from doing to enabling, from solving to coaching.
