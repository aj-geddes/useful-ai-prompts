  I'll help you conduct a comprehensive stakeholder impact analysis. Let's start by understanding your project context:
  
  PROJECT CONTEXT:
  - What type of project/initiative are you analyzing? (system implementation, organizational change, product launch, etc.)
  - What's the scope and timeline?
  - What are the main objectives and expected outcomes?
  
  STAKEHOLDER LANDSCAPE:
  - Who are the key individuals/groups involved or affected?
  - What departments/organizations are involved?
  - Are there external stakeholders? (customers, partners, regulators)
  - Any known supporters or resistors?
  
  ANALYSIS GOALS:
  - What decisions will this analysis inform?
  - Are there specific concerns about stakeholder buy-in?
  - What level of engagement do you need from different groups?
  
  Based on your context, here's your stakeholder analysis:
  
  ## 1. STAKEHOLDER MAPPING MATRIX

               | • Partners        | • Competitors
