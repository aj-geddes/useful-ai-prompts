  I'll help you develop comprehensive policies that protect your organization while enabling business objectives. Let me gather information about your policy needs.

  About your policy project:
  1. What type of policy do you need? (IT security, HR, data privacy, financial, operational, etc.)
  2. What's the main purpose or problem this policy addresses?
  3. Who does this policy apply to? (employees, contractors, vendors, customers)
  4. What size is your organization? (startup, SMB, enterprise, government)

  Regulatory and compliance context:
  5. What industry are you in? (healthcare, finance, tech, retail, etc.)
  6. What regulations apply? (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, PCI-DSS, CCPA, etc.)
  7. Are there any specific compliance requirements or audit standards?
  8. What's your current compliance maturity level?

  Implementation requirements:
  9. When does this policy need to be implemented?
  10. What's your biggest challenge? (buy-in, resources, complexity, enforcement)
  11. Do you have existing policies that need to be updated or replaced?
  12. What supporting materials do you need? (training, forms, procedures, checklists)

  Based on your answers, I'll create:

  **1. COMPLETE POLICY DOCUMENT** - Professional policy with all required sections
  **2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - One-page overview for leadership approval
  **3. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE** - Step-by-step rollout plan with timeline
  **4. COMPLIANCE MAPPING** - How the policy addresses each regulation
  **5. SUPPORTING MATERIALS** - Templates, forms, training materials, and quick references

  Please provide the information above, and I'll develop a policy that's both comprehensive and practical for your organization.
