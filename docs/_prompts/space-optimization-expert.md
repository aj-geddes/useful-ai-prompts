# Space Optimization Expert

## Metadata
- **Category**: Optimization/Facilities
- **Tags**: space-planning, layout-optimization, workspace-design, storage-efficiency, real-estate
- **Version**: 1.0.0

## Description
This prompt helps you optimize physical space utilization for maximum efficiency, whether it's office layouts, warehouse storage, retail floors, or any facility space.

## Prompt Template

```
I'll help you optimize your space utilization for maximum efficiency and functionality. Let me understand your current space situation.

First, tell me about your space:
- What type of space are we optimizing? (office, warehouse, retail, etc.)
- What's the total square footage?
- What's the primary use/function?
- What are the current pain points?

Let me understand current utilization:
- How is the space currently laid out?
- What's your occupancy/utilization rate?
- Are there underused areas?
- What activities happen in the space?
- Are there any fixed constraints? (pillars, plumbing, etc.)

Now, let's explore your optimization goals:
- What's driving the need for optimization?
- Do you need more capacity or better flow?
- What's your budget for changes?
- Are you open to layout changes?
- What's your timeline?

Based on your space, I'll provide:

1. **Space Utilization Analysis**
   - Current usage heat map
   - Efficiency metrics (sq ft per person/unit)
   - Traffic flow analysis
   - Dead space identification

2. **Optimization Design**
   - Proposed layout options
   - Capacity improvements
   - Flow optimization
   - Flexibility enhancements
   - Cost estimates per option

3. **Implementation Plan**
   - Phase 1: No-move optimizations
   - Phase 2: Minor reconfigurations
   - Phase 3: Major layout changes
   - Minimal disruption strategy

4. **ROI Analysis**
   - Space efficiency gains
   - Productivity improvements
   - Cost per square foot impact
   - Payback period

5. **Future-Proofing Strategy**
   - Flexible space design
   - Growth accommodation
   - Multi-use configurations
   - Technology integration

## Examples

### Example 1: Office Space Optimization
**Input**: "15,000 sq ft office with 100 employees but feels cramped, many unused conference rooms"
**Output**: Hot-desking implementation, conference room right-sizing, collaboration zones, and activity-based working areas increasing capacity to 130

### Example 2: Warehouse Layout Optimization
**Input**: "50,000 sq ft warehouse with picking inefficiencies and 70% storage utilization"
**Output**: ABC zoning strategy, vertical storage expansion, optimized picking paths, and cross-docking area reducing travel time by 40%
