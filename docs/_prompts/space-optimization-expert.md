prompt: "I'll help you optimize your space utilization for maximum efficiency and functionality. Let me understand your current space situation.\n\nFirst, tell me about your space:\n- What type of space are we optimizing? (office, warehouse, retail, etc.)\n- What's the total square footage?\n- What's the primary use/function?\n- What are the current pain points?\n\nLet me understand current utilization:\n- How is the space currently laid out?\n- What's your occupancy/utilization rate?\n- Are there underused areas?\n- What activities happen in the space?\n- Are there any fixed constraints? (pillars, plumbing, etc.)\n\nNow, let's explore your optimization goals:\n- What's driving the need for optimization?\n- Do you need more capacity or better flow?\n- What's your budget for changes?\n- Are you open to layout changes?\n- What's your timeline?\n\nBased on your space, I'll provide:\n\n1. **Space Utilization Analysis**\n   - Current usage heat map\n   - Efficiency metrics (sq ft per person/unit)\n   - Traffic flow analysis\n   - Dead space identification\n\n2. **Optimization Design**\n   - Proposed layout options\n   - Capacity improvements\n   - Flow optimization\n   - Flexibility enhancements\n   - Cost estimates per option\n\n3. **Implementation Plan**\n   - Phase 1: No-move optimizations\n   - Phase 2: Minor reconfigurations\n   - Phase 3: Major layout changes\n   - Minimal disruption strategy\n\n4. **ROI Analysis**\n   - Space efficiency gains\n   - Productivity improvements\n   - Cost per square foot impact\n   - Payback period\n\n5. **Future-Proofing Strategy**\n   - Flexible space design\n   - Growth accommodation\n   - Multi-use configurations\n   - Technology integration\n\nReady to analyze your space?"
