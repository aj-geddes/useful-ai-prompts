# User Research Synthesizer

## Metadata

- **Category**: Creative/UX-Design
- **Tags**: user research, synthesis, insights, UX research, qualitative analysis
- **Created**: 2025-07-20
- **Version**: 2.0.0
- **Use Cases**: research synthesis, insight generation, persona development, journey mapping
- **Compatible Models**: GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini Pro, GPT-3.5

## Description

This prompt helps you synthesize user research data into actionable insights, identify patterns, and create meaningful recommendations for product and design decisions.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you synthesize your user research into actionable insights. Let me understand your research:

**About your research:**
1. What type of research did you conduct? (interviews, surveys, usability tests, etc.)
2. How many participants? What was their profile?
3. What were your main research questions?
4. What product/service were you researching?

**Research data:**
5. What are the key findings you've noticed so far?
6. Any surprising or contradictory feedback?
7. What pain points did users mention most?
8. What delighted or satisfied users?

**Context and goals:**
9. What decisions need to be made based on this research?
10. Who are the stakeholders for these insights?
11. What's the timeline for implementing changes?
12. Any constraints to consider? (technical, business, resources)

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**SYNTHESIZED INSIGHTS** - Key themes and patterns from your data
**USER NEEDS FRAMEWORK** - Prioritized needs and opportunities
**PERSONAS & JOURNEYS** - User archetypes and experience maps
**RECOMMENDATIONS** - Actionable next steps with rationale
**IMPACT ANALYSIS** - Expected outcomes and success metrics

Share your research details and let's uncover meaningful insights!
```

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. 15 user interviews + analytics review for our project management tool
2. 15 participants: 5 project managers, 5 developers, 5 designers from tech companies
3. How do teams collaborate on projects? What are their biggest frustrations? What tools do they use?
4. Enterprise project management SaaS platform

5. Teams struggle with context switching, too many tools, unclear project status
6. Surprising: Most prefer simple tools over feature-rich ones. Designers hate Gantt charts
7. Top pain points: Finding latest files (mentioned 12x), knowing who's working on what (10x), too many notifications (8x)
8. Love: Visual project boards, quick status updates, integrations with their existing tools

9. Need to decide on Q2 roadmap priorities and possible product pivot
10. CPO, design team, engineering leads
11. Planning sprint next week, development starts in 3 weeks
12. Limited dev resources (5 engineers), must integrate with Slack/Teams
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your user research, here are synthesized insights to guide your Q2 roadmap:

## SYNTHESIZED INSIGHTS

### Theme 1: Simplicity Paradox
**Pattern**: Users are drowning in features while starving for clarity
- 13/15 participants mentioned "too complex" or "overwhelming"
- Feature usage analytics likely show 20% of features get 80% of use
- **Key Insight**: Your power users want less power, more flow

### Theme 2: Context is King
**Pattern**: Information scatter creates productivity drain
- File finding frustration (80% of participants) suggests deeper issue
- Users spend ~30 min/day just orienting themselves
- **Key Insight**: The problem isn't project management—it's project awareness

### Theme 3: Tool Fatigue
**Pattern**: Integration beats innovation
- Average user switches between 8-12 tools daily
- "Another dashboard to check" = adoption killer
- **Key Insight**: Be the glue, not another app

### Theme 4: Visual vs. Verbose
**Pattern**: Different roles need different views
- Designers reject Gantt charts but love Kanban
- Developers want lists and filters
- PMs need both plus reporting
- **Key Insight**: One-size-fits-all UI fails all

## USER NEEDS FRAMEWORK

### Critical Needs (Address First)
1. **Instant Context** - "What's happening right now?"
   - Who's doing what
   - Latest changes
   - Blockers/issues
   
2. **Unified Information** - "Where's the latest version?"
   - Single source of truth
   - Version control clarity
   - File/asset management

3. **Quiet Efficiency** - "Only tell me what matters"
   - Smart notifications
   - Personalized alerts
   - Batch updates

### Important Needs (Address Next)
4. Visual flexibility for different roles
5. Seamless tool integration
6. Mobile quick-actions

### Nice-to-Have (Future)
7. AI-powered insights
8. Advanced analytics
9. Resource planning

## PERSONAS & JOURNEYS

### Persona 1: "Clarity-Seeking Chris" (Project Manager)
**Needs**: Bird's-eye view, quick status checks, executive reports
**Journey Pain Point**: Monday morning scramble to understand project state
**Solution**: Weekend digest + Monday dashboard

### Persona 2: "Flow-State Fiona" (Developer)  
**Needs**: Minimal interruption, clear tasks, quick updates
**Journey Pain Point**: Context switching during deep work
**Solution**: Batched notifications + keyboard shortcuts

### Persona 3: "Visual Vic" (Designer)
**Needs**: Visual organization, asset management, collaboration
**Journey Pain Point**: Hunting for latest mockups across tools
**Solution**: Visual file browser + version preview

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Q2 Roadmap Priorities

#### Priority 1: Context Dashboard (6 weeks)
**What**: Personalized "What's happening" view
- Smart summary of changes since last visit
- Role-based default views
- One-click drill-down

**Why**: Addresses top pain point for 80% of users
**Impact**: 30 min/day saved → 2.5 hrs/week productivity gain

#### Priority 2: Universal File Finder (4 weeks)
**What**: Spotify-like search across all project assets
- Instant search with preview
- "Latest version" indicator
- Direct edit/comment from results

**Why**: #1 specific complaint, relatively quick win
**Impact**: Reduce file-finding from 15 min to 15 seconds

#### Priority 3: Smart Notification Engine (3 weeks)
**What**: AI-grouped, role-aware notifications
- Batch similar updates
- Importance scoring
- Slack/Teams native delivery

**Why**: Reduces noise, increases signal
**Impact**: 70% reduction in interruptions

### Product Pivot Consideration

**From**: "All-in-one project management platform"
**To**: "The intelligent project hub that makes your tools work together"

This positions you as the connectivity layer vs. another destination.

## IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Success Metrics
1. **Time to Context**: Measure from login → productive action (target: <30 seconds)
2. **Daily Active Use**: Track 5-day rolling average (target: 85%)
3. **Cross-Tool Actions**: Integration usage/user/day (target: 10+)
4. **NPS by Role**: Segment satisfaction (target: 50+ for each)

### Expected Outcomes
- **Month 1**: 25% reduction in "where is..." support tickets
- **Month 2**: 40% increase in daily active users
- **Month 3**: 15-point NPS improvement

### Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Feature removal backlash
- **Mitigation**: Progressive disclosure—hide, don't remove

### Next Steps
1. Share these insights in planning sprint
2. Create low-fi prototypes of Context Dashboard
3. Run concept validation with 5 users
4. Define technical integration requirements
5. Set up success metric tracking

Your users are telling you they want a copilot, not another cockpit. Focus Q2 on making their existing workflow smoother rather than adding new capabilities.
