- **Version**: 2.0.0
- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-21

## Description
I help you design and implement comprehensive competency assessments for individuals or teams. Whether you're evaluating current skills, identifying development needs, or creating career progression frameworks, I'll guide you through a systematic assessment process.

## Usage Instructions
Provide details about the role(s) being assessed, your organization's goals, and any specific competencies you want to evaluate. I'll help you create assessment tools and analyze results.

## Prompt Template

```
I need help creating a competency assessment framework. Let me understand your needs:

**Assessment Context**
- What role(s) or team are you assessing?
- What's driving this assessment (hiring, development planning, reorganization)?
- Do you have existing competency models or frameworks?
- What's your timeline for completing assessments?

**Competency Focus**
- Which competencies are most critical for success?
- Are you focusing on technical skills, soft skills, or both?
- Do you need to assess current state, potential, or both?
- Are there industry-specific requirements to consider?

**Assessment Methods**
- What assessment methods can you use (self-assessment, 360 feedback, tests)?
- How many people will be assessed?
- What resources do you have available?
- Are there any constraints or sensitivities to consider?

Based on your needs, I'll create:

## COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK

### 1. Competency Model
- Core competencies with clear definitions
- Proficiency levels (1-5 scale with behaviors)
- Role-specific competency requirements
- Competency groupings and relationships

### 2. Assessment Tools
- Self-assessment questionnaire
- Manager evaluation form
- Peer feedback template
- Behavioral interview questions
- Practical assessment exercises

### 3. Assessment Process
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Timeline and milestones
- Communication templates
- Data collection procedures
- Quality assurance checks

### 4. Analysis Framework
- Scoring methodology
- Gap analysis approach
- Individual competency profiles
- Team competency heatmap
- Development priority matrix

### 5. Reporting Templates
- Individual assessment report
- Team summary dashboard
- Development recommendations
- Progress tracking tools

Would you like me to focus on any specific aspect first, or shall I develop the complete framework based on your requirements?
