## Description

A practical risk assessment assistant that helps you identify, analyze, and mitigate risks across your organization. Provide your risk context and I'll deliver comprehensive risk analysis with prioritized mitigation strategies.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you conduct a comprehensive risk assessment and develop mitigation strategies. Let me gather information about your organization and risk concerns.

About your organization:
1. What type of organization? (industry, size, structure)
2. What's your role in risk management?
3. What's driving this risk assessment? (annual review, incident, compliance, etc.)
4. What's your risk appetite? (conservative, moderate, aggressive)

Risk scope and focus:
5. What areas need assessment? (operational, financial, cyber, strategic, compliance)
6. What time horizon? (current risks, emerging threats, long-term)
7. Any specific risks you're concerned about?
8. What recent incidents or near misses have occurred?

Current risk management:
9. What risk controls do you currently have?
10. How mature is your risk management? (basic, developing, advanced)
11. What data/information is available for analysis?
12. Who needs to see the results? (executives, board, regulators)

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**1. RISK HEAT MAP** - Visual risk prioritization with probability vs impact
**2. TOP RISKS ANALYSIS** - Detailed assessment of critical risks
**3. RISK INTERCONNECTIONS** - How risks cascade and amplify each other
**4. MITIGATION STRATEGIES** - Prioritized action plans with ROI analysis
**5. MONITORING PLAN** - Key indicators and early warning signals

Please provide the information above to begin your risk assessment.

## TOP 3 CRITICAL RISKS

### Risk #1: Cybersecurity Attack (Score: 9.1/10)

**Current Exposure:**
- Probability: Very High (80% chance in next 12 months)
- Impact: Critical ($15-50M potential loss)
- Velocity: Hours to full impact

**Vulnerability Assessment:**
```
Security Gaps Identified:
├── Outdated systems: 35% of infrastructure
├── Email security: Basic filtering only  
├── Employee training: Annual only, low engagement
├── Backup systems: Not tested for 18 months
├── Incident response: Plan exists but untested
└── Third-party access: Minimal monitoring
```

**Attack Scenarios:**
- **Ransomware (60% probability)**: $8-15M ransom + downtime costs
- **Data breach (30% probability)**: $5-10M regulatory fines + reputation
- **Supply chain hack (10% probability)**: $20-50M operational disruption

### Risk #2: Supply Chain Disruption (Score: 8.7/10)

**Current Dependencies:**
- Single-source suppliers: 40% of critical components
- Geographic concentration: 70% from Asia-Pacific
- Financial health: 3 suppliers showing distress signals
- Inventory buffers: 30 days average (industry standard: 45)

**Disruption Scenarios:**
- **Supplier bankruptcy**: 2-3 month production halt, $25M impact
- **Geopolitical disruption**: 6-month delays, $40M impact  
- **Natural disaster**: 1-month regional shutdown, $10M impact

### Risk #3: Regulatory Changes (Score: 8.2/10)

**Regulatory Landscape:**
- New ESG reporting requirements (2025)
- Stricter environmental standards pending
- Supply chain transparency laws
- Data privacy regulations expanding

**Compliance Gaps:**
```
Current vs Required Capabilities:
ESG Reporting:     ███░░░░░░░ 30% ready
Environmental:     ██████░░░░ 60% ready  
Supply Chain:      ████░░░░░░ 40% ready
Data Privacy:      ███████░░░ 70% ready

## RISK INTERCONNECTIONS

**Cascade Analysis:**
```
Cyber Attack
     ├── Operational Shutdown
     │   ├── Customer Impact
     │   ├── Revenue Loss  
     │   └── Reputation Damage
     ├── Data Breach
     │   ├── Regulatory Fines
     │   ├── Legal Liability
     │   └── Customer Churn
     └── Recovery Costs
         ├── System Rebuilding
         ├── Investigation Costs
         └── Enhanced Security

Risk Amplification Effects:

• Regulatory + Reputation = Enforcement escalation
• Financial stress amplifies all operational risks
```
