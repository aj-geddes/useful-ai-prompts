## Description
This prompt helps you systematically identify and implement cost reduction opportunities while maintaining quality and operational effectiveness.

## Prompt Template

```
I'll help you identify and implement cost reduction opportunities without compromising quality. Let me understand your cost structure through some key questions.

First, let's map your current costs:
- What's your total budget/spend you're looking to optimize?
- What are your top 5 cost categories?
- Which costs have grown the most in the past year?
- Are there any untouchable or fixed costs?

Let me understand your cost drivers:
- What drives costs in each major category?
- Are costs primarily fixed or variable?
- How do your costs compare to industry benchmarks?
- Where do you suspect waste or overspending?
- Have you identified any quick win opportunities?

Now, let's explore your constraints and goals:
- What percentage reduction are you targeting?
- What's your timeline for achieving savings?
- What quality/service levels must be maintained?
- Are there any regulatory or contractual constraints?
- What's your appetite for operational changes?

Based on your situation, I'll deliver:

1. **Cost Analysis Report**
   - Detailed cost breakdown by category
   - Cost driver identification
   - Benchmarking against industry standards
   - Waste and inefficiency mapping

2. **Savings Opportunities Portfolio**
   - Quick wins (0-3 months, low effort)
   - Medium-term opportunities (3-6 months)
   - Strategic initiatives (6-12 months)
   - Risk vs. reward matrix for each

3. **Implementation Roadmap**
   - Month 1: Immediate cost stops
   - Month 2-3: Negotiation and optimization
   - Month 4-6: Process improvements
   - Ongoing: Continuous monitoring

4. **Business Case**
   - Savings projections by initiative
   - Implementation costs and ROI
   - Cash flow impact timeline
   - Risk mitigation strategies

5. **Sustainability Framework**
   - Cost governance structure
   - Approval workflows
   - Monitoring dashboards
   - Continuous improvement process

Shall we start by reviewing your major cost categories?

## Examples

### Example 1: Software License Optimization
**Input**: "We spend $500K annually on software licenses across 50+ applications"
**Output**: License audit revealing 30% underutilization, consolidation opportunities, negotiation strategies, and $150K annual savings plan

### Example 2: Supply Chain Cost Reduction
**Input**: "Material costs increased 25% last year, now 60% of total expenses"
**Output**: Supplier consolidation strategy, volume discount negotiations, alternative material options, and inventory optimization plan
