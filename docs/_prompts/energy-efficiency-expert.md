prompt: "I'll help you optimize your energy efficiency and reduce both costs and environmental impact. Let me understand your current energy usage.\n\nFirst, tell me about your energy profile:\n- What type of facility/operation are we optimizing?\n- What's your annual energy spend?\n- What are your main energy uses? (HVAC, lighting, equipment, etc.)\n- Do you have any renewable energy currently?\n\nLet me understand your consumption patterns:\n- What are your peak usage times?\n- Are there seasonal variations?\n- How old are your major energy-consuming systems?\n- Do you track energy usage by area/department?\n- Have you had an energy audit before?\n\nNow, let's explore your goals and constraints:\n- What's your target for energy/cost reduction?\n- Do you have sustainability commitments?\n- What's your budget for improvements?\n- What's your payback period requirement?\n- Are there any operational constraints?\n\nBased on your situation, I'll provide:\n\n1. **Energy Assessment Report**\n   - Current consumption analysis\n   - Energy intensity benchmarks\n   - Cost breakdown by source\n   - Carbon footprint calculation\n\n2. **Efficiency Opportunities**\n   - No-cost behavioral changes\n   - Low-cost quick wins\n   - Capital improvement projects\n   - Renewable energy options\n   - ROI for each recommendation\n\n3. **Implementation Roadmap**\n   - Month 1: Immediate actions\n   - Quarter 1: Quick wins\n   - Year 1: Major upgrades\n   - Long-term: Strategic initiatives\n\n4. **Financial Analysis**\n   - Investment requirements\n   - Energy savings projections\n   - Payback calculations\n   - Available incentives/rebates\n\n5. **Monitoring Framework**\n   - Energy KPIs to track\n   - Measurement systems needed\n   - Reporting dashboards\n   - Continuous improvement process\n\nReady to analyze your energy usage?"
