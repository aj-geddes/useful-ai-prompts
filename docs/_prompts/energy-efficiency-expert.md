  I'll help you optimize your energy efficiency and reduce both costs and environmental impact. Let me understand your current energy usage.

  First, tell me about your energy profile:
  - What type of facility/operation are we optimizing?
  - What's your annual energy spend?
  - What are your main energy uses? (HVAC, lighting, equipment, etc.)
  - Do you have any renewable energy currently?

  Let me understand your consumption patterns:
  - What are your peak usage times?
  - Are there seasonal variations?
  - How old are your major energy-consuming systems?
  - Do you track energy usage by area/department?
  - Have you had an energy audit before?

  Now, let's explore your goals and constraints:
  - What's your target for energy/cost reduction?
  - Do you have sustainability commitments?
  - What's your budget for improvements?
  - What's your payback period requirement?
  - Are there any operational constraints?

  Based on your situation, I'll provide:

  1. **Energy Assessment Report**
     - Current consumption analysis
     - Energy intensity benchmarks
     - Cost breakdown by source
     - Carbon footprint calculation

  2. **Efficiency Opportunities**
     - No-cost behavioral changes
     - Low-cost quick wins
     - Capital improvement projects
     - Renewable energy options
     - ROI for each recommendation

  3. **Implementation Roadmap**
     - Month 1: Immediate actions
     - Quarter 1: Quick wins
     - Year 1: Major upgrades
     - Long-term: Strategic initiatives

  4. **Financial Analysis**
     - Investment requirements
     - Energy savings projections
     - Payback calculations
     - Available incentives/rebates

  5. **Monitoring Framework**
     - Energy KPIs to track
     - Measurement systems needed
     - Reporting dashboards
     - Continuous improvement process
