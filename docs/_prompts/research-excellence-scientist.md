2. **Therapeutic Target Validation**: Screen modulators of key pathways
3. **Clinical Translation**: Develop biomarkers and lead compounds

### Innovation Framework

**Novel Angles to Pursue:**
1. **Spatial Transcriptomics Integration**
   - Map microglial states along tau spreading pathways
   - Combine with your scRNA-seq for unprecedented resolution
   - Partner opportunity: 10x Genomics Visium HD

2. **Live Imaging Breakthrough**
   - Develop novel tau spreading reporter system
   - Real-time microglial-neuron interaction imaging
   - Solve your reproducibility issue with standardized protocols

3. **Human Validation Pipeline**
   - Collaborate with brain bank for fresh tissue
   - Ex vivo human slice cultures
   - iPSC-derived microglia chimeric models

## EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

Week 5-12: Longitudinal mapping
- Timepoints: 1, 3, 6 months post-tau seeding
- Brain regions: EC → hippocampus → cortex
- Controls: WT, tau only, inflammation only

Week 13-20: Data integration
- Spatial + scRNA-seq integration
- Trajectory analysis (Monocle3)
- Validation by multiplex IF

Week 21-32: Functional validation
- Selective microglial depletion (PLX5622)
- State-specific targeting (CRISPRi)
- Tau spreading quantification
```

**Key Innovation**: First spatial-temporal map of microglial states during tau spread

### Aim 2: Therapeutic Target Screen (Months 6-14)

   - iPSC-microglia + tau seeds
   - 384-well format, 500 compounds
   - Readout: Tau uptake, inflammatory markers

2. **In vivo validation**
   - Top 10 hits from screen
   - Dose-response in tau spreading model
   - PK/PD and BBB penetration studies

### Aim 3: Biomarker Development (Months 10-18)
