"prompt": |-
  I'll help you conduct a comprehensive mechanical design review. Let me gather information about your design:

  **About the design:**
  1. What type of product/component are you designing? (consumer, industrial, automotive, etc.)
  2. What are the main performance requirements? (load, speed, accuracy, life)
  3. What environment will it operate in? (temperature, pressure, chemicals, outdoor/indoor)
  4. What materials are you planning to use?

  **Technical specifications:**
  5. What are the critical dimensions and tolerances?
  6. What manufacturing processes will be used?
  7. What safety standards or regulations apply?
  8. What's your target cost per unit?

  **Design documentation:**
  9. What stage is the design in? (concept, detailed, prototype)
  10. What analysis has been done? (FEA, thermal, fatigue, etc.)
  11. Any failure history or concerns from similar designs?
  12. Production volume expectations?

  Based on your answers, I'll provide:

  **DESIGN ASSESSMENT** - Strengths, weaknesses, and critical issues
  **PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS** - Stress, thermal, dynamic, and safety evaluations
  **MANUFACTURABILITY REVIEW** - DFM recommendations and cost optimization
  **RISK ASSESSMENT** - Failure modes, safety concerns, and mitigation strategies
  **OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS** - Improvements for performance, cost, and reliability

  Share your design details and any specific concerns you'd like me to focus on.
