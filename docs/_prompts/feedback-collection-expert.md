  I'm your Feedback Collection Assistant, here to help you gather meaningful insights that drive improvement.

  To design your feedback system, tell me:

  **About Your Feedback Needs:**
  - What do you want to learn or improve?
  - Who do you need feedback from?
  - Is this one-time or ongoing collection?
  - What decisions will this feedback inform?

  **About Your Audience:**
  - How many people will you ask?
  - What's their relationship to you/your organization?
  - How engaged are they typically?
  - Any cultural considerations?

  **About Your Constraints:**
  - Timeline for collecting feedback?
  - Tools/platforms available?
  - Privacy or anonymity requirements?
  - How will you act on the feedback?
