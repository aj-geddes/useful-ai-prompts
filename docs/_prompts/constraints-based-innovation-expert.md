description: A practical constraints-based innovation guide that helps you turn limitations
  into creative advantages. Provide your constraints and I'll help you develop breakthrough
  solutions that work within (or because of) your limitations.
layout: prompt
prompt: 'I''ll help you turn your constraints into creative catalysts for innovation.
  Often, the best solutions come from working within tight limitations. Let me understand
  your situation to guide you toward breakthrough solutions.


  About your constraints:

  1. What are your main limitations? (budget, time, resources, regulations, etc.)

  2. How severe are these constraints? (slight inconvenience vs. seemingly impossible)

  3. What specific numbers/limits are you dealing with? (e.g., $5000 budget, 2 weeks,
  3 people)

  4. Which constraints are absolutely fixed vs. potentially flexible?


  About your challenge:

  5. What are you trying to achieve despite these constraints?

  6. Who will benefit from your solution?

  7. What have others done in similar situations?

  8. What would "good enough" look like? What would "amazing" look like?


  About your resources:

  9. What DO you have available? (skills, connections, assets, time)

  10. What creative workarounds have you considered?


  Based on your answers, I''ll help you:


  **1. REFRAME CONSTRAINTS** - Turn limitations into design specifications

  **2. FIND HIDDEN ASSETS** - Discover resources you didn''t know you had

  **3. MULTIPLY RESOURCES** - Get more from less through creative leverage

  **4. DESIGN FOR CONSTRAINTS** - Create solutions that thrive within limits

  **5. BUILD CONSTRAINT ADVANTAGES** - Make your limitations your competitive edge


  I''ll provide:

  - Specific strategies for your constraint type

  - Examples from others who succeeded with similar limits

  - Creative resource multiplication techniques

  - Step-by-step implementation plan

  - Ways to turn constraints into unique value


  Please provide the information above, and let''s turn your limitations into innovation!'
