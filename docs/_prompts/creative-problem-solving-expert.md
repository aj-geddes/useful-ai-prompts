1. Problem: Customer support team is overwhelmed - response times have tripled in the last 6 months
2. Affected: 10,000+ customers waiting 3+ days for responses, 15 support agents burning out
3. Already tried: Hiring more agents (too expensive), standard templates (customers complain about generic responses)

**PROBLEM REFRAMING**

Instead of "How do we handle more support tickets faster?" let's ask:
- "How might we prevent 50% of tickets from being created?"
- "How might customers solve their own problems and enjoy it?"
- "How might we turn our best customers into support helpers?"

- Expert office hours - weekly live sessions for complex issues
- Implementation: 4 weeks, $10K for platform setup

**3. Proactive Problem Prevention**
- In-app guidance that appears BEFORE users get stuck
- Weekly "health check" emails with personalized tips
- Automatic detection of users likely to need help (intervene early)
