I'll help you create a personalized habit formation system. Let me understand your goals and challenges:

**Current Habits:**

2. What bad habits do you want to break?
3. What habits have you successfully maintained in the past?
4. What habit attempts have failed and why?

**Lifestyle Context:**
5. What does your typical daily schedule look like?
6. When do you have the most willpower/energy?
7. What are your biggest sources of stress or disruption?
8. How consistent is your routine week to week?

**Motivation and Environment:**
9. What's driving your desire to change these habits?
10. Who in your life supports your goals?

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Exercise 4x/week, read 30 min daily, meditate 10 min morning
2. Stop mindless social media scrolling, reduce evening snacking
3. Brushing teeth, morning coffee routine, weekend meal prep
4. Gym membership (too ambitious), meditation apps (forgot to use)

5. Work 9-5, commute 30 min each way, dinner around 7 PM
6. Most energy 6-8 AM and right after work
7. Work deadlines, long commutes, social obligations
8. Weekdays consistent, weekends vary significantly

9. Want more energy, better focus, feel more accomplished
10. Partner supportive, friends mixed (some gym buddies, some party friends)
11. Home gym space available, phone is major distraction
12. Prefer simple visual tracking, not complex apps
```

**Assistant Output:**

Here's your personalized habit formation strategy:

## HABIT STACK DESIGN

**Morning Stack (6:30-7:00 AM):**
```
Existing: Wake up → Coffee
NEW STACK:
1. Wake up → 10 min meditation (before coffee)
2. Coffee → Read for 15 minutes 
3. Reading → Set daily intention

Trigger: Alarm
Reward: Favorite coffee blend
```

**Evening Stack (5:30-6:30 PM):**
```
Existing: Get home from work → Change clothes
NEW STACK:
1. Change clothes → Home workout (15-30 min)
2. Workout → Healthy snack prep
3. Snack prep → Phone in charging station

Trigger: Walking in door
Reward: Favorite post-workout snack
```

## ENVIRONMENT OPTIMIZATION

**Phone/Social Media Control:**
- Phone charging station in living room (not bedroom)
- Delete social apps Sunday night, reinstall Friday evening
- Use website blockers during morning routine (6:30-8 AM)
- Replace phone with book on nightstand

**Exercise Setup:**
- Lay out workout clothes night before
- Create 15-min, 30-min, and 45-min home routines
- Play energizing playlist automatically at 5:30 PM
- Keep water bottle and towel always ready

**Reading Environment:**
- Book on coffee table (visible cue)
- Reading chair setup with good lighting
- Remove other distractions from reading area

## MOTIVATION SYSTEM

**Immediate Rewards:**
- Day 1-7: Small treat after each completed habit
- Week 2-4: Weekly reward for 80%+ completion
- Month 2+: Monthly bigger reward for consistency

**Accountability:**
- Text partner daily habit completion (Y/N format)
- Weekly check-in with gym buddy friend
- Monthly progress photo/measurement

**Visual Tracking:**
- Simple calendar with stickers for each habit
- Green = completed, Yellow = partial, Red = missed
- Focus on streaks, not perfection

## FAILURE RECOVERY PLAN

**When You Miss a Day:**
1. Acknowledge without judgment
2. Identify the trigger that caused the miss
3. Adjust environment to prevent repeat
4. Resume next scheduled time (don't wait for Monday)

**Mini-Versions for Tough Days:**
- Exercise: 5-minute stretch instead of full workout
- Reading: 1 page instead of 30 minutes
- Meditation: 3 deep breaths instead of 10 minutes

**Weekly Reset:**
- Sunday planning: Review week, adjust next week's approach
- If below 60% completion, simplify one habit
- Celebrate any progress made

This system starts small and builds momentum rather than overwhelming you with massive changes.
