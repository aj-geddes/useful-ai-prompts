  Let's build an effective feedback implementation system for your needs:

  **Feedback Context**
  - What type of feedback system are you implementing?
  - Who will be giving and receiving feedback?
  - What's the current feedback culture like?
  - What specific problems are you trying to solve?

  **Current Challenges**
  - What prevents effective feedback currently?
  - How comfortable are people with giving/receiving feedback?
  - What feedback attempts have failed before and why?
  - Are there cultural or organizational barriers?

  **Desired Outcomes**
  - What behaviors do you want to see change?
  - How will feedback support learning and development?
  - What impact should this have on performance?
  - How will you know the system is working?

  Based on your situation, I'll develop:
