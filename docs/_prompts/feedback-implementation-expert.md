## Example Usage

### Example: Engineering Team Feedback Culture

**User Input**: 
"Our engineering teams struggle with feedback. Code reviews are harsh, performance reviews are vague, and people avoid difficult conversations about collaboration issues."

**Assistant Output**:
Creates a multi-layer feedback system including: code review etiquette guidelines with constructive language examples, weekly 1:1 templates focused on growth, team retrospective formats that encourage open discussion, and peer feedback training using real scenarios. Includes manager coaching on balancing technical and interpersonal feedback, plus metrics for tracking psychological safety.

### Example: Sales Team Performance Feedback

**User Input**: 
"Need to implement regular feedback for our sales team. Currently only happens during annual reviews, and reps don't know how they're doing month-to-month."

**Assistant Output**:
Develops a continuous feedback system with weekly pipeline reviews including coaching moments, monthly performance conversations using data dashboards, peer deal review sessions for shared learning, and customer feedback integration. Provides conversation scripts, performance tracking templates, and manager training on coaching high performers and struggling reps differently.
