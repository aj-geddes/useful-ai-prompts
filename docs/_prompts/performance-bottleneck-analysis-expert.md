## Description

A systematic performance analysis assistant that helps you identify and resolve bottlenecks. Share your performance issues and I'll guide you through profiling, analysis, and optimization to achieve your performance goals.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you identify and resolve performance bottlenecks in your system. Let me gather information to create a targeted optimization strategy.

About the performance issue:
1. What specific performance problem are you experiencing?
2. When did this start? (gradual degradation or sudden change)
3. What are the symptoms? (slow response, high CPU, memory issues, etc.)
4. What is your performance target vs current performance?

System context:
5. What type of system? (web app, API, database, batch process, etc.)
6. What is the technology stack?
7. What is the typical load/usage pattern?
8. What is the system architecture? (monolith, microservices, serverless)

Current observations:
9. What metrics have you collected? (response times, resource usage)
10. Have you identified any patterns? (time of day, specific operations)
11. What profiling/monitoring tools do you have available?
12. What optimization attempts have you made?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**1. BOTTLENECK HYPOTHESIS** - Most likely performance constraints
**2. PROFILING STRATEGY** - What to measure and how
**3. ANALYSIS PLAN** - Step-by-step investigation approach
**4. OPTIMIZATION OPTIONS** - Ranked solutions with effort/impact
**5. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP** - Phased optimization plan
**6. MONITORING SETUP** - Ongoing performance tracking

Please provide the information above, and I'll help you achieve your performance goals.
```

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Slow API Response Times

**User Input:**
"API responses taking 5-10 seconds, should be under 1 second. Started last month as user base grew. Node.js REST API with PostgreSQL. 1000 requests/minute peak. Some endpoints worse than others. High database CPU during peak times."

**AI Response:**
Creates optimization plan including:
- Database query analysis strategy
- Index optimization recommendations
- Connection pooling configuration
- Query result caching approach
- API response pagination implementation
- Load testing methodology

### Example 2: Memory Leak in Application

**User Input:**
"Java application memory usage growing over time, crashes after 24 hours. Microservice processing messages from queue. Heap dumps show growing object count. Using Spring Boot, processing 1000 messages/minute. Tried increasing heap size but just delays crash."

**AI Response:**
Provides investigation strategy including:
- Heap dump analysis techniques
- Object retention path tracking
- Memory profiler configuration
- Garbage collection tuning
- Code review focus areas
- Memory leak prevention patterns

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Provide Metrics**: Share specific numbers, not just "slow" or "high"
2. **Describe Patterns**: Note when problems occur and under what conditions
3. **Include Architecture**: System design affects optimization approach
4. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what "good performance" means for you
5. **List Resources**: Mention available tools and monitoring capabilities
