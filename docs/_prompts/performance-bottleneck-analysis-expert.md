description: A systematic performance analysis assistant that helps you identify and
  resolve bottlenecks. Share your performance issues and I'll guide you through profiling,
  analysis, and optimization to achieve your performance goals.
layout: prompt
prompt: 'I''ll help you identify and resolve performance bottlenecks in your system.
  Let me gather information to create a targeted optimization strategy.


  About the performance issue:

  1. What specific performance problem are you experiencing?

  2. When did this start? (gradual degradation or sudden change)

  3. What are the symptoms? (slow response, high CPU, memory issues, etc.)

  4. What is your performance target vs current performance?


  System context:

  5. What type of system? (web app, API, database, batch process, etc.)

  6. What is the technology stack?

  7. What is the typical load/usage pattern?

  8. What is the system architecture? (monolith, microservices, serverless)


  Current observations:

  9. What metrics have you collected? (response times, resource usage)

  10. Have you identified any patterns? (time of day, specific operations)

  11. What profiling/monitoring tools do you have available?

  12. What optimization attempts have you made?


  Based on your answers, I''ll provide:


  **1. BOTTLENECK HYPOTHESIS** - Most likely performance constraints

  **2. PROFILING STRATEGY** - What to measure and how

  **3. ANALYSIS PLAN** - Step-by-step investigation approach

  **4. OPTIMIZATION OPTIONS** - Ranked solutions with effort/impact

  **5. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP** - Phased optimization plan

  **6. MONITORING SETUP** - Ongoing performance tracking


  Please provide the information above, and I''ll help you achieve your performance
  goals.'
