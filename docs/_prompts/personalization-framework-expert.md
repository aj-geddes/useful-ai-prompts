  I'll help you create a comprehensive personalization framework. Let's understand your needs:
  
  PERSONALIZATION CONTEXT:
  - What channels need personalization? (website, email, app, etc.)
  - What customer data is available for personalization?
  - Current personalization efforts and their performance?
  
  BUSINESS OBJECTIVES:
  - Primary goals? (engagement, conversion, retention, revenue)
  - Key customer segments to focus on?
  - Success metrics and benchmarks?
  
  TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES:
  - What customer data platforms and tools exist?
  - Real-time vs. batch processing preferences?
  - Integration requirements with existing systems?
  
  Here's your personalization framework:
  
  ## 1. DATA FOUNDATION
  
  **Customer Data Model**:
  | Data Type | Source | Update Frequency | Use Cases |
  |-----------|--------|------------------|-----------|
  | Demographics | Registration | One-time | Segmentation |
  | Behavioral | Interactions | Real-time | Recommendations |
  | Transactional | Purchase history | Daily | Product affinity |
  | Contextual | Session data | Real-time | Experience optimization |
  
  **Identity Resolution**:
  - Cross-device tracking
  - Email/login matching
  - Probabilistic matching
  - Customer ID unification
  
  ## 2. SEGMENTATION STRATEGY
  
  **Dynamic Segments**:
  - Behavioral patterns (browser, purchaser, abandoner)
  - Lifecycle stage (new, growing, loyal, at-risk)
  - Value tiers (high, medium, low lifetime value)
  - Engagement level (highly active, moderate, dormant)
  
  **Micro-Segmentation**:
  - Product affinity clusters
  - Channel preference groups
  - Time-based behavior patterns
  - Intent signal combinations
  
  ## 3. PERSONALIZATION TACTICS
  
  **Content Personalization**:
  - Dynamic homepage layouts
  - Personalized product recommendations
  - Customized email campaigns
  - Tailored content feeds
  
  **Experience Optimization**:
  - Navigation customization
  - Search result ranking
  - Pricing and promotion targeting
  - Channel experience adaptation
  
  ## 4. RECOMMENDATION ENGINE
  
  **Algorithm Mix**:
  - Collaborative filtering (user-based, item-based)
  - Content-based filtering
  - Matrix factorization
  - Deep learning models
  
  **Recommendation Types**:
  - "Customers also bought"
  - "Recommended for you"
  - "Recently viewed alternatives"
  - "Trending in your category"
  
  ## 5. TESTING & OPTIMIZATION
  
  **A/B Testing Framework**:
  - Hypothesis formation
  - Test design and statistical power
  - Segment-specific testing
  - Multi-variate optimization
  
  **Performance Metrics**:
  - Engagement rates (CTR, time on site)
  - Conversion metrics (purchase rate, AOV)
  - Revenue impact (per visitor, per segment)
  - Customer satisfaction scores
  
  ## 6. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
  
  **Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)**:
  - Data collection and unification
  - Basic segmentation setup
  - Simple rule-based personalization
  
  **Phase 2: Intelligence (Months 3-4)**:
  - Machine learning model development
  - Recommendation engine implementation
  - Advanced segmentation
  
  **Phase 3: Optimization (Months 5-6)**:
  - Real-time personalization
  - Cross-channel orchestration
  - Advanced testing capabilities
  
  ## 7. PRIVACY & GOVERNANCE
  
  **Data Privacy**:
  - Consent management
  - Data retention policies
  - GDPR/CCPA compliance
  - Anonymization strategies
  
  **Quality Controls**:
  - Data accuracy monitoring
  - Algorithm bias detection
  - Performance degradation alerts
  - Customer feedback integration
