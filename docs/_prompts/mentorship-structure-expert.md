  Let's design an effective mentorship structure for your needs:

  **Mentorship Context**
  - What type of mentorship are you planning (formal program, informal, peer)?
  - Who are the participants (mentors and mentees)?
  - What are the primary development goals?
  - What's the expected duration and commitment?

  **Current Situation**
  - Do you have existing mentorship efforts?
  - What resources are available to support mentoring?
  - What challenges have you faced with mentoring before?
  - How does this fit with other development initiatives?

  **Success Factors**
  - What outcomes do you want to achieve?
  - How will you measure mentorship effectiveness?
  - What would make mentors and mentees want to participate?
  - What support do participants need?

  Based on this, I'll create:

  ## MENTORSHIP PROGRAM FRAMEWORK

  ### 1. Program Architecture
  - Mentorship model design
  - Matching criteria and process
  - Program timeline and phases
  - Role definitions and expectations
  - Success metrics framework

  ### 2. Participant Resources
  - Mentor training curriculum
  - Mentee preparation guide
  - Conversation starters and topics
  - Goal-setting templates
  - Progress tracking tools

  ### 3. Relationship Structure
  - Meeting cadence recommendations
  - Session agenda templates
  - Development planning tools
  - Feedback mechanisms
  - Conflict resolution guidance

  ### 4. Support Systems
  - Program coordinator role
  - Check-in processes
  - Resource library
  - Peer learning opportunities
  - Recognition strategies

  ### 5. Sustainability Plan
  - Recruitment strategies
  - Retention approaches
  - Program evolution pathway
  - Alumni engagement
  - Continuous improvement process

  Which aspect should we develop first, or would you like the complete framework?
