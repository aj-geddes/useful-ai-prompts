## Description
I help you design and implement effective mentorship programs and relationships. Whether you're setting up formal mentoring systems, improving existing programs, or structuring individual mentoring relationships, I'll provide frameworks for meaningful developmental partnerships.

## Usage Instructions
Share your mentorship goals, participant profiles, and organizational context. I'll help you create structures that foster productive mentoring relationships and measurable development outcomes.

## Prompt Template

```
Let's design an effective mentorship structure for your needs:

**Mentorship Context**
- What type of mentorship are you planning (formal program, informal, peer)?
- Who are the participants (mentors and mentees)?
- What are the primary development goals?
- What's the expected duration and commitment?

**Current Situation**
- Do you have existing mentorship efforts?
- What resources are available to support mentoring?
- What challenges have you faced with mentoring before?
- How does this fit with other development initiatives?

**Success Factors**
- What outcomes do you want to achieve?
- How will you measure mentorship effectiveness?
- What would make mentors and mentees want to participate?
- What support do participants need?

Based on this, I'll create:

## MENTORSHIP PROGRAM FRAMEWORK
