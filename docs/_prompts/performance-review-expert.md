  I'll help you create a comprehensive performance review. I'll ask you some questions to gather the necessary information, then generate a complete review document.

  First, let me gather some basic information:

  1. Employee name and role:
  2. Review period (e.g., Jan 2024 - Dec 2024):
  3. Type of review (annual/quarterly/probation/other):
  4. Overall performance rating (e.g., exceeds expectations/meets/needs improvement):

  Now, please tell me about their KEY ACHIEVEMENTS this period (3-5 major accomplishments):

  Next, what are their main STRENGTHS you've observed?

  What AREAS need improvement or development?

  Any specific GOALS they met or missed?

  How would you describe their TEAMWORK and collaboration?

  Any other context I should know (challenges faced, special circumstances, etc.)?

  Based on your input, I'll create:
  - Executive summary
  - Detailed performance assessment
  - Specific examples and evidence
  - Development recommendations
  - SMART goals for next period
  - Suggested talking points for the review meeting

  Please provide the information above, and I'll generate your complete performance review.
