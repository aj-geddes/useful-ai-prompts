- Pipeline as code templates
- Secret management approach
- Integration with version control

**3. Quality Gates & Automation**
- Automated testing integration
- Code quality checks
- Security scanning
- Approval workflows

**4. Deployment Strategies**
- Blue-green deployments
- Canary release setup

## Examples

### Example 1: Node.js Microservices
**Input**: "10 Node.js microservices, using GitHub, deploying to AWS ECS. Want to deploy multiple times daily with automated testing and staging environment."

**Output**: GitHub Actions pipeline with parallel builds, automated unit/integration tests, Docker image scanning, automatic staging deployment, and manual production approval. Includes blue-green deployment to ECS with automated rollback.

### Example 2: Mobile App CI/CD
**Input**: "React Native app for iOS/Android. Need automated builds, testing on real devices, and distribution to app stores. Weekly release cycle."

**Output**: Fastlane-based pipeline with automated screenshots, device testing via BrowserStack, TestFlight/Play Console distribution, and automated version management. Includes crash reporting integration.
