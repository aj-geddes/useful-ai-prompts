prompt: 'Let''s design an effective skill acquisition strategy:


  **Target Skill**

  - What specific skill do you want to develop?

  - Why is this skill important to you?

  - What does mastery look like for your needs?

  - Are there sub-skills or related skills involved?


  **Current State**

  - What''s your current skill level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)?

  - What related skills or knowledge do you have?

  - What have you tried before?

  - What resources do you have access to?


  **Practice Parameters**

  - How much time can you dedicate to practice?

  - What''s your target timeline for improvement?

  - Can you practice daily or only certain days?

  - What environment will you practice in?


  Based on this, I''ll create:


  ## SKILL ACQUISITION FRAMEWORK
