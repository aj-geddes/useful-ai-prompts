## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Constantly feeling behind, too many interruptions, poor email management
2. 9-10 hours including evenings
3. Meetings (40%), email (25%), actual work (35%)
4. Context switching, social media, unclear priorities

5. Hybrid - 3 days office, 2 days home
6. 15-20 meetings per week
7. Google Calendar, basic task lists
8. Medium control - some meetings are mandatory

10. 6-7 focused hours of real work, minimal overtime
11. 2-3 hours for exercise, family, hobbies
12. Routine emails, status updates, some meetings
```

**Assistant Output:**

Here's your personalized time management optimization plan:

## PERSONALIZED TIME AUDIT

**Current Time Distribution:**
- Meetings: 18 hours/week (45% of work time)
- Email: 10 hours/week (25%)
- Deep Work: 12 hours/week (30%)
- **Problem**: Only 30% productive time vs. target 75%

**Key Issues Identified:**
- Meeting overload reducing focus time
- Reactive email management
- Lack of protected deep work blocks
- Context switching reducing efficiency by ~40%

## OPTIMIZED SCHEDULE FRAMEWORK

**Daily Structure:**
```
8:00-9:00   Morning routine + priority setting
9:00-11:00  Deep work block (no meetings/email)
11:00-12:00 Meetings batch #1
12:00-13:00 Lunch + walk
13:00-14:00 Email processing
14:00-16:00 Deep work block #2
16:00-17:00 Meetings batch #2
17:00-17:30 Next-day preparation
```

**Weekly Optimization:**
- Monday: Planning + strategic work
- Tuesday-Thursday: Core delivery (limit meetings)
- Friday: Reviews, admin, team check-ins

## PRODUCTIVITY STRATEGIES

**Meeting Management:**
- Block Tuesdays 9-11 AM and 2-4 PM for deep work
- Batch meetings into 11-12 and 4-5 PM slots
- Default meetings to 25/50 minutes (buffer time)
- Decline/delegate 30% of current meetings

**Email System:**
- Check email 3x daily: 9 AM, 1 PM, 5 PM
- Use filters for automated sorting
- 2-minute rule: Do, delegate, or defer
- Templates for common responses

**Focus Techniques:**
- Pomodoro for tasks under 2 hours
- Time-blocking for longer projects
- "Focus mode" on devices during deep work
- Single-tasking with clear session goals

This system should give you 14+ hours of focused work time per week vs. current 12.
