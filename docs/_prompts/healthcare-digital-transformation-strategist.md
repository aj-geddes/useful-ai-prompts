2. What's your patient volume and geographic coverage? (beds, visits, locations, population served)
3. What clinical specialties and services do you provide?
4. What's your current annual technology budget and IT infrastructure?

**Digital maturity assessment:**
5. What EHR system do you use and how optimized is it? (basic, functional, optimized)
6. What digital capabilities do you currently have? (telehealth, patient portals, mobile apps)
7. How do clinicians currently interact with technology? (satisfied, frustrated, mixed)
8. What data analytics and reporting capabilities exist?

**Transformation objectives and challenges:**
9. What are your primary digital transformation goals? (efficiency, quality, cost, experience)
10. What are your biggest operational pain points? (workflow inefficiencies, documentation burden)
