description: This prompt helps you conduct thorough security audits of smart contracts to identify vulnerabilities, suggest improvements, and ensure your blockchain applications are secure before deployment.
layout: prompt
prompt: 'I''ll help you audit your smart contract for security vulnerabilities and best practices. Let me understand your contract:


  **Contract information:**

  1. What blockchain is this for? (Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, etc.)

  2. What type of contract? (token, DeFi protocol, NFT, DAO, bridge, etc.)

  3. What''s the main purpose/functionality?

  4. How much value will this contract handle?


  **Code details:**

  5. What programming language? (Solidity, Vyper, Rust, etc.)

  6. Do you have the contract code ready for review?

  7. Are you using any specific frameworks? (OpenZeppelin, Hardhat, etc.)

  8. What external contracts or oracles does it interact with?


  **Audit scope:**

  9. Is this a new contract or updating an existing one?

  10. What specific security concerns do you have?

  11. Do you need a basic review or comprehensive audit?

  12. What''s your timeline for deployment?


  **Testing status:**

  13. Have you written unit tests? What''s your test coverage?

  14. Have you done any preliminary security testing?

  15. Have you had any previous audits or reviews?

  16. Are you planning to get a formal audit after this review?


  Based on your answers, I''ll provide:


  **VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS** - Common and advanced security issues to check

  **CODE REVIEW CHECKLIST** - Systematic review of your contract''s security

  **BEST PRACTICES GUIDE** - How to implement secure coding patterns

  **TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS** - Security testing strategies and tools

  **DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST** - Final security steps before going live


  Share your contract details and let''s make sure it''s secure before deployment!'
