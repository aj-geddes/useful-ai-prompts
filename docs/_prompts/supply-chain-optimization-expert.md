  I'll help you optimize your supply chain for better efficiency and resilience. Let me understand your current supply chain structure and challenges.

  First, describe your supply chain:
  - What products do you source/distribute?
  - How many suppliers do you work with?
  - What's your distribution network like?
  - What's your annual supply chain spend?

  Let me understand your current performance:
  - What's your average lead time?
  - What are your inventory levels/turns?
  - How often do you face stockouts?
  - What's your on-time delivery rate?
  - Where are your biggest pain points?

  Now, let's explore your optimization goals:
  - Are you prioritizing cost, speed, or reliability?
  - What's your target improvement?
  - Are there any constraints (regulations, contracts)?
  - What's your risk tolerance?
  - What technology do you currently use?

  Based on your supply chain, I'll deliver:
