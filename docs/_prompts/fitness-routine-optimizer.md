## PERSONALIZED WORKOUT PLAN

**Phase 1: Foundation Building (Weeks 1-4)**
*Focus: Movement habits, basic strength, cardiovascular base*

**Schedule: 4 days/week, 30 minutes each**
```
Monday - Full Body Strength (20 min) + Walk (10 min)
Tuesday - Active Recovery (gentle yoga/stretching)
Thursday - Cardio + Core (30 min)
Saturday - Full Body Strength (20 min) + Walk (10 min)
```

**Sample Strength Workout:**
1. Bodyweight squats: 2 sets × 8-12 reps
2. Wall push-ups: 2 sets × 8-12 reps
3. Resistance band rows: 2 sets × 10-15 reps
4. Modified planks: 2 sets × 15-30 seconds
5. Light dumbbell exercises: 2 sets × 10-12 reps

**Cardio Options:**
- Brisk walking (start with 15 min, build to 25 min)
- Dancing to music (20-30 min)
- Low-impact YouTube fitness videos

## PROGRESSION STRATEGY

**Week 1-2: Habit Formation**
- Focus on showing up consistently
- Light intensity, emphasize proper form
- Track completion, not performance

**Week 3-4: Volume Increase**
- Add 5 minutes to workouts
- Increase reps by 2-3 per exercise
- Add one extra set to strength exercises

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Intensity Building**
- Increase weights by 2-5 lbs where appropriate
- Add more challenging exercise variations
- Extend cardio sessions to 25-30 minutes

**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Strength Focus**
- Move to 3 sets for all exercises
- Introduce compound movements (squats with weights)
- Consider adding gym workouts 1-2x/week

## NUTRITION GUIDANCE

**Basic Principles for Weight Loss + Energy:**
- Eat protein at every meal (aim for 20-30g per meal)
- Fill half your plate with vegetables at lunch and dinner
- Stay hydrated: water before coffee, throughout day
- Plan for 3 meals + 1-2 healthy snacks

**Pre/Post Workout Nutrition:**
- Before: Light snack if working out >2 hours after eating
- After: Protein + carbs within 30 minutes (Greek yogurt + fruit)

**Energy Management:**
- Avoid processed foods that cause energy crashes
- Eat complex carbs (oats, quinoa) for sustained energy
- Consider meal prep Sundays for consistency

## HABIT INTEGRATION SYSTEM

**Environmental Setup:**
- Lay out workout clothes night before
- Set up exercise space permanently (if possible)
- Queue up playlist and water bottle
- Schedule workouts like important meetings

**Habit Stacking:**
- Morning: Workout → Shower → Coffee (existing routine)
- Evening: Change work clothes → Workout → Dinner prep

**Backup Plans:**
- 15-minute workout for busy days
- Walking meetings when possible
- Desk stretches during work breaks

## MOTIVATION AND TRACKING PLAN

**Progress Tracking:**
- Weekly weigh-ins (same day, same time)
- Monthly body measurements and photos
- Daily energy levels (1-10 scale)
- Workout completion (simple yes/no calendar)

**Motivation Milestones:**
- Week 2: Reward for consistency (new workout playlist)
- Week 4: Small celebration (healthy dinner out)
- Week 8: Bigger reward (new workout clothes)
- Week 12: Major celebration (weekend getaway)

**Accountability:**
- Text friend/partner after each workout
- Weekly check-in with supportive family member
- Join online fitness community for encouragement

This plan starts sustainable and builds momentum gradually to create lasting fitness habits.
