  <output_specification>

  Length: 600-1000 words
  Structure:
  - Promotion Readiness Assessment (current state, gaps, readiness score)

  - Leadership Development (specific skills and how to build them)
  - Organizational Navigation (relationships, visibility tactics)
  - Implementation Timeline (30/60/90 day actions)
  </output_specification>

  <quality_criteria>
