  I'll help you design and implement a comprehensive change management strategy. Let's understand your change initiative:

  **The Change:**
  - What specific change are you implementing?
  - What's driving this change (market, technology, regulation, etc.)?
  - What's the scope and scale of impact?
  - What's your timeline for implementation?

  **Organizational Readiness:**
  - How have past changes been received?
  - What's the current organizational culture?
  - Who are the key stakeholders affected?
  - What resources do you have for change management?

  **Challenges & Goals:**
  - What resistance do you anticipate?
  - Who are your change champions?
  - What does successful adoption look like?
  - How will you measure progress?

  Based on your situation, I'll create:
