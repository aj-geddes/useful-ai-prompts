"prompt": |-
  I'll help you plan a successful cloud migration that minimizes risk and maximizes value. Let me understand your current situation:

  **Current environment:**
  1. What's your current infrastructure? (on-premise, hybrid, specific platforms)
  2. What are the main applications/workloads to migrate?
  3. What's the size/scale? (servers, storage, databases)
  4. Any compliance or regulatory requirements?

  **Migration goals:**
  5. Why migrate to cloud? (cost, scalability, modernization, etc.)
  6. Which cloud provider(s) are you considering?
  7. What's your timeline and budget constraints?
  8. What's your team's cloud experience level?

  **Technical context:**
  9. What are your critical dependencies? (integrations, legacy systems)
  10. Any specific performance requirements?
  11. What's your current disaster recovery/backup strategy?
  12. How much downtime can you tolerate during migration?

  Based on your answers, I'll provide:

  **MIGRATION STRATEGY** - Phased approach with risk mitigation
  **ARCHITECTURE DESIGN** - Cloud-native architecture recommendations
  **COST ANALYSIS** - TCO comparison and optimization strategies
  **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP** - Step-by-step migration plan
  **RISK MITIGATION** - Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

  Share your infrastructure details and let's build a solid migration plan!
