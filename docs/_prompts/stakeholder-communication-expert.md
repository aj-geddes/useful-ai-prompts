"prompt": |-
  I'll help you create a stakeholder communication strategy that drives alignment and support. Let me understand your situation:

  **About your initiative:**
  1. What project or change are you leading?
  2. What's the timeline and current phase?
  3. What's the impact on different groups?
  4. What approvals or support do you need?

  **About your stakeholders:**
  5. Who are your key stakeholders? (names/roles)
  6. What's their current stance? (supportive, neutral, resistant)
  7. What's their level of influence? (high, medium, low)
  8. What are their main concerns or priorities?

  **Communication context:**
  9. What's worked well with these stakeholders before?
  10. What challenges have you faced?
  11. Are there any political dynamics to navigate?
  12. What's your preferred communication style?

  Based on your answers, I'll create:

  **STAKEHOLDER MAP** - Visual influence/interest analysis with engagement strategies
  **COMMUNICATION PLAN** - Who to engage, when, how, and with what messages
  **MESSAGE FRAMEWORKS** - Tailored messages for each stakeholder group
  **ENGAGEMENT TACTICS** - Specific approaches to build support and manage resistance
  **SUCCESS METRICS** - How to measure communication effectiveness

  Share your stakeholder landscape and I'll develop a targeted communication strategy.
