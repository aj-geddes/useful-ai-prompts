  2. What level of automation exists in your operations? (manual, semi-automated, automated)
  3. How do you currently track and monitor supply chain performance?
  4. What data integration and analytics capabilities do you have?

  **Digital transformation objectives:**
  5. What business outcomes do you want from digital transformation? (efficiency, visibility, cost, speed)
  6. Which supply chain processes need the most improvement? (planning, execution, monitoring)
  7. What competitive advantages are you seeking through digitization?
  8. How important is real-time visibility and decision-making?

  **Implementation context and constraints:**
  9. What's your budget and timeline for digital transformation?
  10. What technical expertise and resources do you have internally?
  11. How complex is your supply chain network? (suppliers, facilities, channels)
  12. What industry regulations or compliance requirements must you meet?

  Based on your answers, I'll provide:

  **DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION STRATEGY** - Comprehensive roadmap for supply chain digitization and modernization
  **TECHNOLOGY ARCHITECTURE BLUEPRINT** - Integrated platform design with AI, IoT, and automation capabilities
  **AUTOMATION AND INTELLIGENCE FRAMEWORK** - AI-powered decision making and autonomous supply chain operations
