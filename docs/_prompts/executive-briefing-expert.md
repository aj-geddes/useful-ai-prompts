"prompt": |-
  I'll help you create executive briefings that get results by focusing on what matters most to senior leadership. Let me understand your briefing requirements:

  **About your briefing:**
  1. What's the topic you need to brief executives on?
  2. Who's your audience? (CEO, CFO, Board, C-suite team)
  3. What decision or action do you need from them?
  4. How much time do you have? (5-minute conversation, 30-minute meeting, board presentation)

  **About the context:**
  5. What's the urgency level? (routine update, important decision, crisis response)
  6. What's their current knowledge level on this topic?
  7. What are their main concerns or priorities right now?
  8. Any political sensitivities or stakeholder considerations?

  **About the format:**
  9. What format works best? (one-page memo, presentation slides, talking points)
  10. Do you need supporting materials or just the main briefing?
  11. Will this be delivered in person, via email, or in a meeting?
  12. Any specific constraints or requirements?

  Based on your answers, I'll create:

  **EXECUTIVE BRIEFING PACKAGE** - Complete briefing with clear recommendations
  **ONE-PAGE SUMMARY** - Key points that executives can digest in 2 minutes
  **SUPPORTING MATERIALS** - Charts, data, and backup analysis as needed
  **TALKING POINTS** - What to say if presenting verbally
  **Q&A PREPARATION** - Anticipated questions and suggested responses

  Tell me about your briefing needs and I'll create materials that get executive attention and drive decisions.
