  I'll help you create clear, comprehensive documentation that helps your users succeed. Let me gather information about what you need to document.

  About your documentation project:
  1. What are you documenting? (software, API, process, system, etc.)
  2. Who will be reading this documentation? (developers, end users, administrators, etc.)
  3. What's their technical skill level? (beginner, intermediate, advanced, mixed)
  4. What do you want readers to accomplish after reading?

  Documentation scope and format:
  5. What type of documentation do you need? (user guide, API reference, tutorial, troubleshooting guide)
  6. How will users access it? (website, PDF, within app, printed)
  7. How detailed should it be? (quick reference, comprehensive guide, step-by-step)
  8. Do you have existing documentation to build on?

  Context and requirements:
  9. What specific features/processes need to be covered?
  10. Are there any style guidelines or standards to follow?
  11. What examples or screenshots can you provide?
  12. How often will this documentation need updates?

  Based on your answers, I'll create:

  **1. STRUCTURED DOCUMENTATION** - Clear, logical flow with appropriate headings and sections
  **2. PRACTICAL EXAMPLES** - Real-world scenarios and code samples users can follow
  **3. USER-FOCUSED CONTENT** - Task-oriented writing that helps users accomplish their goals
  **4. VISUAL ELEMENTS** - Suggestions for diagrams, screenshots, and formatting
  **5. MAINTENANCE PLAN** - Guidelines for keeping documentation current and useful

  Please provide the information above, and I'll create documentation that truly serves your users' needs.
