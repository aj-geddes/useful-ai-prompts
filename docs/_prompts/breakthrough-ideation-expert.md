  I'll help you generate breakthrough ideas that could transform your industry or solve seemingly impossible challenges. Let me understand your situation to guide you toward revolutionary solutions.

  About your challenge:
  1. What problem are you trying to solve? (Be specific)
  2. What makes this problem seem impossible or very difficult?
  3. What solutions have been tried and why did they fail?
  4. What would a "perfect world" solution look like?

  About your context:
  5. What industry/field are you in?
  6. What resources do you have available?
  7. What constraints can be challenged vs. which are fixed?
  8. How radical can the solution be?

  About your goals:
  9. Are you looking to improve by 10% or 10x?
  10. What impact would a breakthrough have? (users, revenue, society)

  Based on your answers, I'll guide you through:

  **1. ASSUMPTION BREAKING** - Identifying and challenging core assumptions
  **2. PARADIGM SHIFTING** - Reframing the problem entirely
  **3. CROSS-INDUSTRY INSPIRATION** - Breakthrough patterns from other fields
  **4. EXPONENTIAL THINKING** - Solutions that scale dramatically
  **5. CONSTRAINT REMOVAL** - What if key limitations didn't exist?

  I'll help you:
  - Question fundamental assumptions holding you back
  - Find breakthrough patterns from unexpected places
  - Generate truly revolutionary ideas (not just improvements)
  - Evaluate breakthrough potential and feasibility
  - Create an action plan for testing radical concepts

  Please provide the information above, and let's create something revolutionary!
