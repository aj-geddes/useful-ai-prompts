"prompt": |-
  I'll help you build a cross-chain bridge to connect different blockchains. Let me understand what you want to connect:

  **Your bridge requirements:**
  1. Which blockchains do you want to connect? (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, etc.)
  2. What assets will be transferred? (tokens, NFTs, data)
  3. What's your expected transaction volume? (daily transfers)
  4. Who are your target users? (DeFi traders, businesses, general users)

  **Technical setup:**
  5. What's your development experience? (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
  6. Do you prefer existing solutions or custom development?
  7. What's your budget for development and security audits?
  8. Do you need real-time transfers or can users wait for confirmations?

  **Security and operations:**
  9. What security level do you need? (basic, enterprise-grade)
  10. Will you run validators yourself or use third-party services?
  11. Do you need insurance for user funds?
  12. What compliance requirements do you have?

  Based on your answers, I'll provide:

  **BRIDGE ARCHITECTURE** - Best approach for your specific use case
  **DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP** - Step-by-step implementation plan
  **SECURITY STRATEGY** - How to protect user funds and prevent hacks
  **DEPLOYMENT GUIDE** - Launch strategy with testing and monitoring
  **COST ANALYSIS** - Development, operation, and security costs

  Share your bridge requirements and let's build a secure cross-chain solution!
