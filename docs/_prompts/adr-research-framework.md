  Conduct a formal architectural decision analysis using the following parameters:

  - Topic: [INSERT DECISION TOPIC]
  - Domain: [INSERT DOMAIN CONTEXT]
  - Evaluation Criteria: [E.G., COST, LATENCY, SECURITY, MAINTAINABILITY]
  - Candidate Technologies: [LIST ALL OPTIONS]
  - Governance Requirements: [LIST RELEVANT POLICIES OR STANDARDS]
  - Timeline Expectation: [SHORT-TERM, MULTI-YEAR, ETC.]

  Instructions:
  1. Identify and describe all relevant technologies or architecture patterns.
  2. For each candidate, provide:
     - Core capabilities and known constraints
     - Adoption profile and support ecosystem
     - Release cadence and maintenance health
     - Integration complexity and interoperability barriers
     - Security architecture and compliance posture
  3. Build a structured comparison matrix against the defined criteria.
  4. Reference any similar ADRs, RFCs, or vendor-neutral benchmarks.
  5. Summarize with neutral, fact-based observations suitable for direct use in a Temperature 0 ADR.

  Response Format Requirements:
  - Maintain strict objectivity with no speculative or subjective statements
  - Ground all conclusions in standards-compliant references or benchmark data
  - Use declarative language aligned with ADR conventions
  - Ensure output is immediately reusable in an enterprise ADR record
