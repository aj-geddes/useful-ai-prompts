layout: prompt
prompt: "Conduct a formal architectural decision analysis using the following parameters:\n\n- Topic: [INSERT DECISION TOPIC]\n- Domain: [INSERT DOMAIN CONTEXT]\n- Evaluation Criteria: [E.G., COST, LATENCY, SECURITY, MAINTAINABILITY]\n- Candidate Technologies: [LIST ALL OPTIONS]\n- Governance Requirements: [LIST RELEVANT POLICIES OR STANDARDS]\n- Timeline Expectation: [SHORT-TERM, MULTI-YEAR, ETC.]\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify and describe all relevant technologies or architecture patterns.\n2. For each candidate, provide:\n   - Core capabilities and known constraints\n   - Adoption profile and support ecosystem\n   - Release cadence and maintenance health\n   - Integration complexity and interoperability barriers\n   - Security architecture and compliance posture\n3. Build a structured comparison matrix against the defined criteria.\n4. Reference any similar ADRs, RFCs, or vendor-neutral benchmarks.\n5. Summarize with neutral, fact-based observations suitable for direct use in a Temperature\
  \ 0 ADR.\n\nResponse Format Requirements:\n- Maintain strict objectivity with no speculative or subjective statements\n- Ground all conclusions in standards-compliant references or benchmark data\n- Use declarative language aligned with ADR conventions\n- Ensure output is immediately reusable in an enterprise ADR record"
