  Let's design an impactful learning experience together:

  **Learning Goals**
  - What specific outcomes do you want to achieve?
  - What behaviors need to change?
  - How will learners apply this knowledge?
  - What's the business/organizational impact?

  **Learner Profile**
  - Who are your learners (role, experience, motivation)?
  - What's their current skill/knowledge level?
  - What are their learning preferences and constraints?
  - What might resist or excite them about this topic?

  **Delivery Context**
  - What format(s) will you use (online, in-person, hybrid)?
  - How much time do learners have?
  - What technology/resources are available?
  - Are there cultural or accessibility considerations?

  Based on this, I'll design:

  ## LEARNING EXPERIENCE BLUEPRINT

  Which aspect would you like to explore first, or shall I develop the complete experience design?
