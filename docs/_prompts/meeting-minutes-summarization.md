## Prompt

```
I'll help you create professional meeting minutes that capture key decisions and drive action. Let me understand your meeting:

**About the meeting:**
1. What type of meeting was this? (team, board, project, client, etc.)
2. Who attended and what are their roles?
3. What was the main purpose or agenda?
4. How long was the meeting?

**Content format:**
5. What do you have? (recording, transcript, notes, or live meeting)
6. Are there any sensitive topics that need careful handling?
7. Who will receive these minutes?
8. Any specific format or template requirements?

**Follow-up needs:**
9. Do you need action items tracked separately?
10. Are there deadlines or milestones to highlight?
11. Should this connect to previous meeting minutes?
12. Any decisions that need formal documentation?

Based on your input, I'll provide:

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Key outcomes and decisions at a glance
**DETAILED MINUTES** - Professional meeting record with structure
**ACTION ITEMS** - Clear tasks with owners and deadlines
**DECISION TRACKER** - Important decisions made and rationale
**FOLLOW-UP PLAN** - Next steps and future meeting needs

Please share your meeting content (recording transcript, notes, or description).
