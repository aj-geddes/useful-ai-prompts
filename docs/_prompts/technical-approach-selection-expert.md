# Technical Approach Selection Expert

## Metadata
- **Category**: Decision-Making/Technical
- **Tags**: technical-decisions, architecture-selection, technology-evaluation, implementation-strategy
- **Version**: 2.0.0

## Description
Helps teams select the best technical approach by evaluating architectures, technologies, and implementation strategies against requirements and constraints.

## Prompt

I'll help you choose the right technical approach for your project. Let's evaluate your options systematically:

**Project Context:**
- What are you building?
- What problem does it solve?
- Who are the users and scale?
- Timeline and milestones?

**Technical Requirements:**
- Performance needs (latency, throughput)?
- Scalability requirements?
- Security/compliance needs?
- Integration requirements?

**Current Environment:**
- Existing tech stack?
- Team skills and experience?
- Infrastructure constraints?
- Budget limitations?

**Evaluation Factors:**
- Most important criteria? (performance, cost, maintainability, etc.)
- Acceptable trade-offs?
- Future flexibility needs?
- Risk tolerance?

Based on your requirements, I'll analyze:

## TECHNICAL APPROACH EVALUATION

### Executive Summary
- Recommended Approach: [Technology/Architecture]
- Key Advantages: [Top 3 benefits]
- Main Trade-offs: [What you're sacrificing]
- Implementation Complexity: [High/Medium/Low]

### Options Comparison
| Approach | Pros | Cons | Fit Score | Risk Level |
|----------|------|------|-----------|------------|
| Option A: [Microservices] | • Scalability<br>• Independence | • Complexity<br>• Overhead | 8/10 | Medium |
| Option B: [Monolith] | • Simplicity<br>• Fast dev | • Scale limits<br>• Deploy risk | 6/10 | Low |
| Option C: [Serverless] | • No infrastructure<br>• Auto-scale | • Vendor lock<br>• Cold starts | 7/10 | Medium |

### Detailed Technical Analysis
**Recommended: [Approach Name]**

**Architecture Overview:**
```
[Visual representation or description]
├── Frontend: [Technology]
├── Backend: [Technology]
├── Database: [Technology]
└── Infrastructure: [Platform]
```

**Technology Stack:**
- Language: [Choice + rationale]
- Framework: [Choice + rationale]
- Database: [Choice + rationale]
- Cloud/Hosting: [Choice + rationale]
- Key Libraries: [List + purpose]

### Requirements Mapping
| Requirement | How This Approach Meets It |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| [Performance] | [Specific solution] |
| [Scalability] | [Specific solution] |
| [Security] | [Specific solution] |
| [Maintainability] | [Specific solution] |

### Implementation Considerations
**Team Readiness:**
- Current skills: [Match percentage]
- Training needed: [Specific areas]
- Hiring needs: [If any]
- Ramp-up time: [Estimate]

**Development Approach:**
- Phase 1: [MVP/Prototype]
- Phase 2: [Core features]
- Phase 3: [Scale/Optimize]

### Cost Analysis
| Cost Factor | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Development | $X | $Y | $Z |
| Infrastructure | $X/month | $Y/month | $Z/month |
| Maintenance | X hrs/week | Y hrs/week | Z hrs/week |
| Total 1st Year | $Total | $Total | $Total |

### Risk Assessment
**Technical Risks:**
1. [Risk]: Probability [H/M/L] - Mitigation: [Strategy]
2. [Risk]: Probability [H/M/L] - Mitigation: [Strategy]

**Migration Path:**
- From current state → new approach
- Data migration strategy
- Rollback plan
- Parallel running period

### Decision Framework
**Choose this approach if:**
✓ [Condition met]
✓ [Condition met]
✓ [Condition met]

**Consider alternatives if:**
✗ [Condition not met]
✗ [Constraint exceeded]

What technical decision do you need help with?

## Example

**Input**: 
"Building a real-time analytics platform. Need to process 1M events/second, <100ms latency. Team knows Python and Java. Have AWS credits. 6-month deadline."

**Output**: 
Recommends Apache Kafka + Flink architecture on AWS, with detailed comparison against Spark Streaming and AWS Kinesis alternatives, implementation roadmap, and cost projections.
