<output_specification>
Format: Project Governance Framework with 5 sections
Length: 600-900 words

Sections:
1. Governance Structure - Tiers, roles, forums, authority
2. Decision Framework - RACI, escalation paths
3. Reporting - Dashboards, cadence, content
4. Stakeholder Management - Tiers, communication
5. Control Mechanisms - Stage gates, change control
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs:
- Right-size governance to project risk and complexity
- Clear escalation paths that don't create bottlenecks
- Reporting is decision-oriented, not just status
- Balance oversight with team empowerment

Avoid:
- One-size-fits-all governance regardless of project size
- Governance that slows decisions without adding value
- Reporting for reporting's sake
- Unclear escalation leading to decision paralysis
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Governance overhead should be proportional to project risk
- Preserve team autonomy for day-to-day decisions
- Ensure governance forums have decision authority
- Align with organizational culture and decision-making style
</constraints>
