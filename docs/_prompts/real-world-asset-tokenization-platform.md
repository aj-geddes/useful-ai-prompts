I'll help you build a real-world asset tokenization platform. Let me understand your vision:

**Asset focus:**
1. What assets will you tokenize? (real estate, art, commodities, businesses, vehicles)
2. What's your target market? (retail investors, institutions, accredited investors, global)
3. What investment minimums? (micro-investing $10+, qualified investors $1K+, institutional $100K+)

**Business model:**
5. Revenue streams? (platform fees, management fees, transaction fees, listing fees)
6. Who provides assets? (asset owners, investment firms, real estate developers)
7. What services do you offer? (tokenization only, full asset management, marketplace)
8. Geographic focus? (single country, regional, global)

**Technical requirements:**
9. Which blockchain(s)? (Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, private chains)
10. Regulatory compliance needs? (SEC, EU MiFID, local securities laws)
11. Integration requirements? (banking, custody, KYC/AML, asset management)
12. Budget and timeline? (MVP, full platform, enterprise solution)

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**TOKENIZATION ARCHITECTURE** - Smart contracts and compliance framework

        uint256 tokenSupply;
        uint256 annualIncome;
        bytes32 propertyId;
        bool isActive;
    }
    
    struct InvestorProfile {
        bool isAccredited;
        uint256 maxInvestment;
        bytes32 kycHash;
        uint256 investmentLimit;
    }
    
    mapping(address => InvestorProfile) public investors;
    PropertyDetails public property;
    
    // Automated compliance checks
    function canTransfer(
        bytes32 partition,
        address from, 
        address to, 
        uint256 value,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external view returns (bool) {
        return _validateTransfer(from, to, value);
    }
    
    // Automated income distribution
    function distributeIncome(uint256 totalIncome) external onlyRole(ASSET_MANAGER) {
        uint256 perTokenIncome = totalIncome / totalSupply();
        for (uint i = 0; i < tokenHolders.length; i++) {
            uint256 holderIncome = balanceOf(tokenHolders[i]) * perTokenIncome;
            _transferIncome(tokenHolders[i], holderIncome);
