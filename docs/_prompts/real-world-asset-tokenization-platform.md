  I'll help you build a real-world asset tokenization platform. Let me understand your vision:

  1. What assets will you tokenize? (real estate, art, commodities, businesses, vehicles)
  2. What's your target market? (retail investors, institutions, accredited investors, global)
  3. What investment minimums? (micro-investing $10+, qualified investors $1K+, institutional $100K+)
  4. What's your unique advantage? (expertise, access, technology, regulation)

  **Business model:**
  5. Revenue streams? (platform fees, management fees, transaction fees, listing fees)
  6. Who provides assets? (asset owners, investment firms, real estate developers)
  7. What services do you offer? (tokenization only, full asset management, marketplace)
  8. Geographic focus? (single country, regional, global)

  **Technical requirements:**
  9. Which blockchain(s)? (Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, private chains)
  10. Regulatory compliance needs? (SEC, EU MiFID, local securities laws)
  11. Integration requirements? (banking, custody, KYC/AML, asset management)
  12. Budget and timeline? (MVP, full platform, enterprise solution)

  Based on your answers, I'll provide:

  **INVESTOR PLATFORM** - KYC, portfolio management, and trading interface
  **REGULATORY COMPLIANCE** - Securities law compliance and reporting automation
  **MARKETPLACE INFRASTRUCTURE** - Trading, liquidity, and settlement systems
