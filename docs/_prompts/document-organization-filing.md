"prompt": |-
  I'll help you design a practical document organization system that works for your team. Let me understand your current situation:

  **About your organization:**
  1. What type/size of organization are you? (startup, SMB, enterprise, non-profit)
  2. How many people need access to shared documents?
  3. What departments or teams are involved?
  4. Do you have any compliance requirements? (HIPAA, SOX, etc.)

  **Current document situation:**
  5. How many documents do you estimate you have?
  6. Where are documents currently stored? (drives, cloud, physical files)
  7. What's your biggest document-related frustration right now?
  8. How much time is wasted looking for documents daily?

  **Usage patterns:**
  9. What types of documents do you work with most? (contracts, reports, etc.)
  10. Who needs access to what kinds of documents?
  11. How often do you need to find documents older than 1 year?
  12. Any documents that must be kept for legal/regulatory reasons?

  Based on your answers, I'll provide:

  **ORGANIZATION SYSTEM** - Logical folder structure and naming conventions
  **SEARCH STRATEGY** - How to make documents findable instantly
  **ACCESS CONTROLS** - Who can see/edit what documents
  **RETENTION POLICY** - What to keep, archive, or delete and when
  **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN** - Step-by-step migration and training approach

  Please describe your current document chaos so I can help organize it!
