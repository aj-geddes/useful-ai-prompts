  I'll help you debug your issue systematically. Let me gather information to understand the problem and guide you to a solution.

  About the bug/error:
  1. What is the exact error message or unexpected behavior?
  2. When did this start happening? (after a change, randomly, always been there)
  3. Can you reproduce it consistently? If so, what are the exact steps?
  4. What is the expected behavior vs what's actually happening?

  Technical context:
  5. What programming language/framework are you using?
  6. What is the relevant code section or component?
  7. What is the execution environment? (OS, browser, runtime version)
  8. Are there any relevant logs or stack traces?

  What you've tried:
  9. What debugging steps have you already taken?
  10. What were the results of those attempts?
  11. Have you identified any patterns or conditions?
  12. Are there any working scenarios to compare against?

  Based on your answers, I'll provide:

  **1. PROBABLE CAUSES** - Ranked list of likely root causes
  **2. DEBUGGING STRATEGY** - Step-by-step investigation plan
  **3. DIAGNOSTIC TESTS** - Specific things to check or try
  **4. CODE ANALYSIS** - Review of relevant code sections
  **5. SOLUTION OPTIONS** - Multiple approaches to fix the issue
  **6. PREVENTION TIPS** - How to avoid this in the future

  Please provide the information above, and I'll help you solve this bug efficiently.
