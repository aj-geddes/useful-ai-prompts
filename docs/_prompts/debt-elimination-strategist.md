## DEBT PAYOFF STRATEGY

**Current Debt Summary:**
- Total Debt: $42,700
- Current Monthly Payments: $735
- Weighted Average Interest: 14.8%

**Recommended: Modified Avalanche Method**
*Start with highest-rate debt but include psychological wins*

**Payment Priority Order:**
1. **Credit Card 1** ($8,500 @ 22.9%) - Highest rate, moderate balance
2. **Credit Card 2** ($4,200 @ 18.5%) - Quick win opportunity  
3. **Car Loan** ($12,000 @ 6.2%) - Moderate rate
4. **Student Loan** ($18,000 @ 4.8%) - Lowest rate, often tax deductible

## PAYMENT OPTIMIZATION PLAN

**Enhanced Payment Strategy:**
- Current minimums: $735/month
- Available extra: $500/month (conservative estimate)
- **Total debt attack**: $1,235/month

**Monthly Allocation:**
```
Credit Card 1: $170 (min) + $500 (extra) = $670
Credit Card 2: $85 (minimum only)
Car Loan: $280 (minimum only)
Student Loan: $200 (minimum only)
```

   - Could save $1,500+ in interest on CC1
   - Transfer fee: ~$250 vs. $1,500 savings
   
2. **Rate Negotiation**: Call both credit card companies
   - Script: "I've been a good customer for X years, struggling with high rates, considering balance transfer. Can you lower my rate?"
   - Target: Even 3-5% reduction saves hundreds

3. **Autopay Discounts**: Set up autopay for 0.25% rate reduction where available
