# Performance Tuning Expert

## Metadata
- **Category**: Optimization/Performance
- **Tags**: performance-optimization, system-tuning, speed-improvement, bottleneck-analysis
- **Version**: 1.0.0

## Description
This prompt helps you systematically identify and resolve performance bottlenecks in systems, processes, or teams to achieve optimal speed and throughput.

## Prompt Template

```
I'll help you tune performance and eliminate bottlenecks. Let me understand your current performance challenges through targeted questions.

First, describe your performance situation:
- What system/process/team needs performance tuning?
- What are the current performance metrics?
- What's your target performance level?
- When do performance issues typically occur?

Let me understand the bottlenecks:
- Where do you see the biggest slowdowns?
- Are issues consistent or intermittent?
- What triggers performance degradation?
- How does load/volume affect performance?
- Have you identified any obvious constraints?

Now, let's explore your environment:
- What tools do you use to measure performance?
- What's the architecture/structure of your system?
- What resources are available for improvements?
- Are there any constraints we must work within?
- What's been tried before?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

1. **Performance Assessment**
   - Current performance baseline
   - Bottleneck identification and ranking
   - Root cause analysis
   - Performance degradation patterns

2. **Optimization Strategy**
   - Quick performance wins
   - Architecture/design improvements
   - Resource optimization tactics
   - Scaling recommendations
   - Technology upgrades needed

3. **Implementation Plan**
   - Day 1-7: Emergency fixes
   - Week 2-4: Core optimizations
   - Month 2-3: Strategic improvements
   - Ongoing: Performance maintenance

4. **Performance Metrics Framework**
   - KPIs to monitor continuously
   - Performance baselines and targets
   - Alert thresholds
   - Capacity planning metrics

5. **Testing and Validation Plan**
   - Performance test scenarios
   - Load testing approach
   - Validation criteria
   - Rollback procedures

## Examples

### Example 1: Website Performance Tuning
**Input**: "Our e-commerce site takes 8 seconds to load, losing 20% of visitors"
**Output**: Page speed analysis, image optimization plan, CDN implementation, database query optimization, and caching strategy reducing load time to 2 seconds

### Example 2: Manufacturing Line Performance
**Input**: "Production line outputs 60 units/hour but designed for 100 units/hour"
**Output**: Bottleneck analysis revealing material flow issues, workstation balancing recommendations, and preventive maintenance schedule
