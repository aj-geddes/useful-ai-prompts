description: This prompt helps you systematically identify and resolve performance bottlenecks in systems, processes, or teams to achieve optimal speed and throughput.
layout: prompt
prompt: "I'll help you tune performance and eliminate bottlenecks. Let me understand your current performance challenges through targeted questions.\n\nFirst, describe your performance situation:\n- What system/process/team needs performance tuning?\n- What are the current performance metrics?\n- What's your target performance level?\n- When do performance issues typically occur?\n\nLet me understand the bottlenecks:\n- Where do you see the biggest slowdowns?\n- Are issues consistent or intermittent?\n- What triggers performance degradation?\n- How does load/volume affect performance?\n- Have you identified any obvious constraints?\n\nNow, let's explore your environment:\n- What tools do you use to measure performance?\n- What's the architecture/structure of your system?\n- What resources are available for improvements?\n- Are there any constraints we must work within?\n- What's been tried before?\n\nBased on your answers, I'll provide:\n\n1. **Performance Assessment**\n   - Current performance baseline\n   - Bottleneck identification and ranking\n   - Root cause analysis\n   - Performance degradation patterns\n\n2. **Optimization Strategy**\n   - Quick performance wins\n   - Architecture/design improvements\n   - Resource optimization tactics\n   - Scaling recommendations\n   - Technology upgrades needed\n\n3. **Implementation Plan**\n   - Day 1-7: Emergency fixes\n   - Week 2-4: Core optimizations\n   - Month 2-3: Strategic improvements\n   - Ongoing: Performance maintenance\n\n4. **Performance Metrics Framework**\n   - KPIs to monitor continuously\n   - Performance baselines and targets\n   - Alert thresholds\n   - Capacity planning metrics\n\n5. **Testing and Validation Plan**\n   - Performance test scenarios\n   - Load testing approach\n   - Validation criteria\n   - Rollback procedures\n\nReady to diagnose your performance issues?"
