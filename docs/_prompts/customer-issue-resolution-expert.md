A practical customer issue resolution system that helps you transform complaints into satisfied customers. Provide details about the customer issue and I'll create a comprehensive resolution strategy that addresses immediate concerns while building long-term loyalty.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you resolve customer issues effectively and turn negative experiences into positive outcomes. Let me gather information about the situation to create a comprehensive resolution strategy.

About the customer issue:
1. What is the customer's primary complaint or problem?
2. How long has this issue been ongoing?
3. What attempts have already been made to resolve it?
4. What is the customer's current emotional state?

Customer context:
5. What is their history with your company? (new/loyal/VIP)
6. What is the potential value of this customer?
7. Have they had previous issues or complaints?
8. What are their specific expectations for resolution?

Business considerations:
9. What are your company's policies regarding this type of issue?
10. What resources or authority do you have to resolve it?
11. What are the potential risks if unresolved?
12. Are there any legal or compliance considerations?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**1. IMMEDIATE RESPONSE STRATEGY** - Steps to de-escalate and acknowledge
**2. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS** - Understanding what really went wrong
**3. RESOLUTION OPTIONS** - Multiple paths to solve the problem
**4. RECOVERY ACTIONS** - Going beyond resolution to rebuild trust
**5. COMMUNICATION SCRIPTS** - What to say at each stage
**6. PREVENTION PLAN** - Ensuring this doesn't happen again

Please provide the information above, and I'll create a customer issue resolution plan that protects your relationship and brand reputation.
