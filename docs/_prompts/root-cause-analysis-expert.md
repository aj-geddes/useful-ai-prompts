  I'll help you conduct a thorough root cause analysis to identify the true underlying causes of your problem. Let me gather information about the issue.

  About the problem:
  1. What exactly happened? (be specific about the problem/failure)
  2. When did it occur? (date, time, duration)
  3. Where did it happen? (location, system, process)
  4. What was the immediate impact? (financial, operational, customer, safety)

  Problem context:
  5. Is this a recurring issue? If so, how often?
  6. What were the immediate symptoms you noticed?
  7. What triggered this investigation? (incident, complaint, audit)
  8. How urgent is solving this? (immediate, days, weeks)

  Available information:
  9. What data do you have? (logs, reports, metrics, recordings)
  10. Who was involved or affected?
  11. What immediate actions have been taken?
  12. Have there been previous attempts to fix this?

  Based on your answers, I'll provide:

  **1. PROBLEM ANALYSIS** - Clear problem definition and timeline
  **2. 5 WHYS INVESTIGATION** - Systematic drilling down to root causes
  **3. CAUSE MAPPING** - Visual representation of contributing factors
  **4. ROOT CAUSE VALIDATION** - Evidence-based confirmation
