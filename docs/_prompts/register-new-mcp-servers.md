prompt: "**Directive Title:** Comprehensive Framework for the Formalized Registration, Validation, and Strategic Dissemination of Model Control Protocol (MCP) Server Artifacts\n\n**Operational Role:** Envision the executing entity as a deeply integrated computational agent operating within a broader MCP orchestration and deployment framework. This agent possesses privileged access to both local MCP tooling—supporting containerized workloads and metadata introspection—and externally available HTTP/S interfaces necessary for interaction with distributed MCP registries. Its function encompasses the autonomous coordination, validation, submission, and lifecycle auditing of emerging MCP server implementations, ensuring that each instance is accurately represented within authoritative community-maintained registries and directories.\n\n**Mission Objective:** Through deterministic automation, the agent is to transform structured metadata (or unstructured user input) representing an MCP server into\
  \ a harmonized registry artifact. This artifact will then be published to all known public, semi-public, and decentralized MCP directories. The goal is to ensure schema fidelity, semantic consistency, interoperability compliance, version standardization, and high discoverability across both machine-readable indices and human-curated registries.\n\n---\n\n### ✨ Phase 1: Repository Intake, Comprehensive Metadata Assessment, Synthesis, and Canonicalization\n\nBegin the process by requesting from the operator or host user a declarative list of MCP server repositories targeted for registration. The input payload should consist of fully qualified URLs referencing publicly hosted version control systems (e.g., GitHub) or absolute paths pointing to locally available MCP server directories.\n\n**Example Input:**\n\n```json\n[\n  \"https://github.com/aj-geddes/fastfs-mcp\",\n  \"https://github.com/aj-geddes/terry-form-mcp\"\n]\n```\n\nFor each MCP repository listed, execute the following expanded\
  \ operational sequence:\n\n1. Clone or fetch the repository into a dedicated, segregated directory under the designated `workspace` mount.\n2. Perform a comprehensive asset scan within the repository to establish:\n   - Programming language(s) used\n   - Presence and type of containerization or runtime artifacts (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, OCI metadata)\n   - Configuration or manifest files (`pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.)\n   - License type and compliance status\n   - README content quality and structure\n   - Default or fallback entrypoint commands or service invocations\n   - Documentation presence (e.g., inline code docs, usage examples, embedded schema comments)\n\n3. Assess the presence of an `mcp-server.json` metadata descriptor file:\n   - If present: Parse, verify schema integrity, check version string format, and perform completeness evaluation\n   - If absent or insufficient: Synthesize a complete and standards-compliant `mcp-server.json`\
  \ using all collected signals\n\n4. Execute field normalization operations:\n   - Enforce naming convention consistency (`snake_case` field names, `PascalCase` artifact references where needed)\n   - Resolve semantic versioning format for `version` and `protocolVersion`\n   - Tokenize descriptive tags using industry-recognized lexicons (e.g., SPDX, OCI labels, opencontainers keywords)\n   - Normalize runtime command syntax, escape platform-specific paths, and encode entrypoints consistently\n\n5. Augment metadata with inferred or synthesized fields derived from empirical analysis of similar MCP server classes. Use probabilistic heuristics based on field distributions across authoritative MCP registries to fill in best-guess defaults where ambiguity exists.\n\n**Sample Metadata Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  name: \"fastfs-mcp\",\n  description: \"A high-performance, file-system-centric MCP server enabling robust CRUD operations, deterministic path traversal, and augmented prompt-driven interactivity.\"\
  ,\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  \"protocolVersion\": \"2024-11-05\",\n  maintainer: \"aj-geddes\",\n  language: \"Python\",\n  \"mcpType\": \"filesystem\",\n  \"tags\": [\"mcp\", \"filesystem\", \"filetools\", \"docker\"],\n  docker: \"ghcr.io/aj-geddes/fastfs-mcp\",\n  \"entryCommand\": [\n    \"docker\",\n    \"run\",\n    \"-i\",\n    \"--rm\",\n    \"-v\",\n    \"C:\\Users\\UserName:/mnt/workspace:rw\",\n    \"aj-geddes/fastfs-mcp\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nPersist the generated or verified metadata descriptor in the appropriate working directory for later reuse across all downstream registration, transformation, and publishing stages. Log each assessment output to facilitate auditability and provide traceability for metadata field origin.\n\nBegin the process by requesting from the operator or host user a declarative list of MCP server repositories targeted for registration. The input payload should consist of fully qualified URLs referencing publicly hosted version control systems (e.g., GitHub)\
  \ or absolute paths pointing to locally available MCP server directories.\n\n**Example Input:**\n\n```json\n[\n  \"https://github.com/aj-geddes/fastfs-mcp\",\n  \"https://github.com/aj-geddes/terry-form-mcp\"\n]\n```\n\nFor each MCP repository listed, execute the following expanded operational sequence:\n\n1. Clone or fetch the repository into a dedicated, segregated directory under the designated `workspace` mount.\n2. Assess the presence of an `mcp-server.json` metadata descriptor file:\n   - If present: Parse, verify structure, perform schema validation, and assess field coverage.\n   - If absent: Infer metadata fields by interrogating repository assets, including `README.md`, `Dockerfile`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `setup.py`, or any other project-specific manifest.\n   - Synthesize a new `mcp-server.json` descriptor in conformance with the MCP protocol specification and best practice standards.\n\n3. Execute field normalization operations:\n   - Enforce schema-valid naming\
  \ conventions (e.g., transform to `snake_case`, ensure `semver` compliance for version fields)\n   - Tokenize tags appropriately for registry classifiers\n   - Assign inferred defaults to missing fields using probabilistic weighting of canonical values and heuristics derived from similar MCP entries\n   - Normalize path syntax and escape sequences\n\n**Sample Metadata Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  name: \"fastfs-mcp\",\n  description: \"A high-performance, file-system-centric MCP server enabling robust CRUD operations, deterministic path traversal, and augmented prompt-driven interactivity.\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  \"protocolVersion\": \"2024-11-05\",\n  maintainer: \"aj-geddes\",\n  language: \"Python\",\n  \"mcpType\": \"filesystem\",\n  \"tags\": [\"mcp\", \"filesystem\", \"filetools\", \"docker\"],\n  docker: \"ghcr.io/aj-geddes/fastfs-mcp\",\n  \"entryCommand\": [\n    \"docker\",\n    \"run\",\n    \"-i\",\n    \"--rm\",\n    \"-v\",\n    \"C:\\\\Users\\\\UserName:/mnt/workspace:rw\"\
  ,\n    \"aj-geddes/fastfs-mcp\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nPersist the generated or verified metadata descriptor in the appropriate working directory for later reuse across all downstream registration, transformation, and publishing stages.\n\n---\n\n### \U0001F517 Phase 2: Discovery and Interface Mapping of Target MCP Registries\n\nUndertake comprehensive enumeration of all known and emergent MCP directories, registries, and metadata aggregation points. For each target platform, determine the method of interaction (interface modality), protocol requirements, and expected artifact format.\n\n**Registry Targets Include:**\n\n1. `modelcontextprotocol/servers` — GitHub-based community registry\n2. `PulseMCP.com` — Web application for community discovery and ranking\n3. `MCP Server Finder` — Metadata-indexed search interface\n4. `mcp-get` — RESTful registry focused on toolchain integration\n5. `awesome-mcp-servers` — GitHub repository of curated server projects\n6. `mcpserver.cloud` and `mcp.run` — Federated,\
  \ decentralized directories\n7. `Cursor.directory` — Specialized index for Cursor AI-compatible tooling\n8. `AIxploria` — Open-source-focused MCP ecosystem index\n\n**Classify the interface characteristics as follows:**\n\n- GitHub-native PR workflows (requires repository fork, branch push, and pull request)\n- Form-based HTTP interfaces (with or without CSRF/token protection)\n- RESTful APIs supporting `POST` or `PUT` for server registration\n- Email or contact form channels with asynchronous moderation (human approval gate)\n\nConstruct an internal registry matrix documenting interface URLs, submission schema requirements, authentication mechanisms, and expected latency or review times.\n\n---\n\n### \U0001F310 Phase 3: Directory Preparation and Automated Registration Workflow Execution\n\n**Directory Initialization:**\nCreate a dedicated working directory for each MCP registry under the mounted `workspace`. These directories will serve as local sandboxes for forked repositories, PR\
  \ metadata, and transformation logs.\n\n**Sample Directory Layout:**\n\n```\n/mnt/workspace/modelcontextprotocol-servers/\n/mnt/workspace/pulsemcp/\n/mnt/workspace/mcp-server-finder/\n/mnt/workspace/mcp-get/\n/mnt/workspace/awesome-mcp-servers/\n/mnt/workspace/mcpserver-cloud/\n/mnt/workspace/cursor-directory/\n/mnt/workspace/aixploria/\n```\n\nEnsure each sandbox is isolated to prevent cross-registry contamination. Initialize version control, logging scaffolds, and output directories within each.\n\n**Execution Routines per Interface Type:**\n\n#### A. GitHub-Based Registries\n\n- Fork the target repository\n- Clone locally into the corresponding working directory\n- Append the MCP descriptor into the correct format and registry file (e.g., `servers.json`, `index.yaml`)\n- Validate local diff\n- Commit changes using a descriptive message: `Add <name>: registration for MCP directory compliance`\n- Push and open a pull request\n- Annotate PR with relevant feature highlights, protocol compliance,\
  \ and schema coverage\n\n#### B. Web Form Registries\n\n- Render submission form interface via automated browser or HTTP POST\n- Map JSON metadata to form fields\n- Submit form, capture redirect URL or success message\n- Archive form submission payloads and HTTP response headers\n\n#### C. REST API Registries\n\n- Authenticate using API key, OAuth token, or JWT\n- Construct registration request body\n- Submit via:\n\n```http\nPOST /servers/register\nContent-Type: application/json\nAuthorization: Bearer <token>\n```\n\n- Log response code, timestamp, and registry confirmation\n\n#### D. Manual Submission Channels\n\n- Generate a Markdown-encoded server description\n- Transmit using SMTP or web form\n- Log outbound message, thread ID, and any reply/confirmation tokens\n\n---\n\n### \U0001F4CB Phase 4: Submission Validation, Registry Auditing, and Compliance Tracking\n\nPost-submission, initiate validation and audit routines:\n\n- Confirm registry ingestion through response codes or visible\
  \ UI updates\n- Persist logs per registry to enable rollback or re-submission\n- Link PR URLs, confirmation tokens, and audit metadata in a centralized tracking file\n\nAugment each `mcp-server.json` file with a cumulative registration vector:\n\n```json\n\"registered_to\": [\"modelcontextprotocol\", \"pulsemcp\", \"mcp-get\", \"awesome-mcp-servers\"]\n```\n\nStore all outputs in structured subdirectories under the respective registry sandboxes.\n\n---\n\n### ⚡ Advanced Enhancements: Version Drift Detection and Documentation Instrumentation\n\n- Compare submitted version metadata to existing registry entries\n- If registry contains older metadata, perform a controlled upgrade via PR or update endpoint\n- Inject visual status indicators (badges) into upstream README or project pages:\n\n```markdown\n![Available on PulseMCP](https://pulsemcp.com/badge/<server-name>.svg)\n```\n\n- Optionally publish a change log, update log, or release note stub per registration event\n\n---\n\n### \U0001F58B\
  ️ Executive Summary\n\nThis document establishes a graduate-level, methodologically robust, and automation-centered protocol for the registration of MCP server assets. Through metadata standardization, reproducible transformation logic, and protocol-compliant interfacing with public registries, this framework ensures long-term interoperability, trustable documentation, and visible community participation.\n\nExecute this procedure for each server in the submitted list and maintain a complete chain-of-custody record for registration, update, and compliance activities.
