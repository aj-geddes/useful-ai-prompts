  I'll help you explain complex concepts effectively. Let me gather some information:

  **Concept Details**
  - What concept do you need to explain?
  - What's the context (training, documentation, presentation)?
  - Why is this concept important for your audience to understand?
  - What are the key learning objectives?

  **Audience Profile**
  - Who is your target audience?
  - What's their current knowledge level on this topic?
  - What's their technical/professional background?
  - How will they apply this knowledge?

  **Learning Preferences**
  - How much time do they have to learn?
  - What format works best (written, visual, interactive)?
  - Are there any common misconceptions to address?
  - What related concepts do they already understand?

  Based on this, I'll create:

  ## CONCEPT EXPLANATION FRAMEWORK

  Which aspect would you like me to develop first, or should I create the complete explanation framework?
