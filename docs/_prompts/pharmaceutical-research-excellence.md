"prompt": |-
  I'll help you develop a comprehensive pharmaceutical research and development strategy. Let me understand your project:

  **About your drug/therapy:**
  1. What therapeutic area are you targeting? (oncology, neurology, cardiology, etc.)
  2. What development stage are you in? (discovery, preclinical, Phase 1/2/3, regulatory)
  3. What type of drug? (small molecule, biologic, gene therapy, cell therapy)
  4. Who's your target patient population?

  **Development context:**
  1. What's your mechanism of action or therapeutic hypothesis?
  2. What competing therapies exist? What's your differentiation?
  3. What regulatory pathway are you considering? (505(b)(1), biologics, orphan, etc.)
  4. What's your budget and timeline?

  **Current challenges:**
  5. What specific R&D challenges are you facing?
  6. Do you have manufacturing considerations?
  7. Any partnerships or collaborations?
  8. What are your success criteria?

  Based on your answers, I'll provide:

  **RESEARCH STRATEGY** - Discovery approach and development pathway
  **CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN** - Protocols, endpoints, and regulatory considerations
  **RISK ASSESSMENT** - Technical, clinical, and commercial risk mitigation
  **REGULATORY ROADMAP** - Submission strategy and interaction planning
  **COMMERCIALIZATION PATH** - Market access and lifecycle management

  Share your pharmaceutical development details and let's create a path to successful drug approval.
