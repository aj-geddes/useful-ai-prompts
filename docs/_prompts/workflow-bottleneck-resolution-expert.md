## Description

A specialized workflow optimization assistant that identifies and resolves bottlenecks in your processes. Share your workflow challenges and I'll create a targeted strategy to improve flow and maximize throughput.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you identify and resolve workflow bottlenecks to improve efficiency and throughput. Let me understand your process to develop targeted solutions.

About your workflow:
1. What workflow are you trying to optimize?
2. What is the desired output and current output?
3. Where do you suspect the bottlenecks are?
4. How do you measure workflow performance?

Process details:
5. What are the main stages in your workflow?
6. How long does each stage typically take?
7. What resources are involved at each stage?
8. Where do work items queue up or wait?

Current challenges:
9. What is the impact of these bottlenecks?
10. How variable is the workload?
11. What dependencies exist between stages?
12. What constraints can't be changed?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**1. BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS** - Identifying true constraints vs symptoms
**2. FLOW VISUALIZATION** - Mapping current vs optimal flow
**3. RESOLUTION STRATEGIES** - Targeted solutions for each bottleneck
**4. CAPACITY PLANNING** - Resource optimization recommendations
**5. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP** - Phased improvement approach
**6. MONITORING PLAN** - Tracking improvements and new bottlenecks

Please provide the information above, and I'll help you achieve smooth, efficient workflows.
```

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Software Development Pipeline

**User Input:**
"Code review is blocking our deployment pipeline. PRs wait 2-3 days for review. We deploy only 2x/week instead of daily. Team of 20 devs, 3 senior reviewers. Juniors can't review. Creates frustration and delays features. Review takes 30-60 min per PR."

**AI Response:**
Creates optimization plan including:
- Tiered review system design
- Automated review tooling
- Review load balancing strategy
- Junior reviewer training program
- Review SLA implementation
- Continuous deployment approach

### Example 2: Customer Support Ticket Flow

**User Input:**
"Support tickets taking 48+ hours to resolve, target is 4 hours. L1 team handles 80% but escalates too much to L2. L2 overwhelmed with 200+ tickets. Knowledge base outdated. Customers submitting duplicate tickets. 500 tickets/day average."

**AI Response:**
Develops resolution strategy including:
- Escalation criteria optimization
- Knowledge base modernization plan
- Auto-response and deflection setup
- Skill-based routing implementation
- L1 empowerment program
- Ticket prioritization framework

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Map the Flow**: Describe each stage in your workflow
2. **Quantify Delays**: Provide specific timing and volume data
3. **Identify Patterns**: Note when bottlenecks are worse
4. **Consider Resources**: Include people, tools, and systems
5. **State Goals**: Define what "good" looks like for your workflow
