  I'll help you build a comprehensive customer retention strategy that prevents churn and grows customer value. Let me understand your current situation:

  **About your customers:**
  1. What type of business model do you have? (subscription, transactional, hybrid)
  2. How many customers do you have and what segments?
  3. What's your average customer lifetime value and contract length?
  4. What's your current churn rate? (monthly, annual)

  **Current challenges:**
  5. What are your biggest retention pain points?
  6. When do customers typically churn? (onboarding, renewal, etc.)
  7. What signals indicate a customer might leave?
  8. How do you currently measure customer health?

  **Resources and goals:**
  9. What's your team structure? (CSMs, support, etc.)
  10. What tools do you use? (CRM, analytics, etc.)
  11. What's your retention target? (reduce churn by X%, increase LTV by Y%)
  12. Who are your main competitors and why do customers switch?

  Based on your answers, I'll provide:

  ## CUSTOMER HEALTH SCORING
  **Multi-dimensional risk assessment framework**

  **Core Health Metrics**:
  - Product usage frequency and depth
  - Feature adoption rate
  - Support ticket volume and sentiment
  - Payment history and billing health
  - Engagement with communications

  **Behavioral Indicators**:
  - Login frequency trends
  - Session duration changes
  - Feature utilization patterns
  - API usage (if applicable)
  - Community participation

  **Health Score Calculation**:
  | Component | Weight | Green (80-100) | Yellow (50-79) | Red (0-49) |
  |-----------|---------|----------------|----------------|------------|
  | Usage | 30% | Daily active | Weekly active | Declining |
  | Adoption | 25% | Advanced features | Basic features | Minimal |
  | Support | 20% | Positive/none | Neutral | Negative trend |
  | Payment | 15% | Current | Minor issues | Overdue |
  | Engagement | 10% | High response | Moderate | Low/none |

  ## CHURN PREDICTION MODEL
  **Early warning system with intervention triggers**

  **Predictive Signals**:
  - Usage decline >30% over 30 days
  - No login for 14+ days
  - Support tickets with negative sentiment
  - Failed payment attempts
  - Cancellation page visits
  - Feature usage plateau
  - Reduced team/seat utilization

  **Risk Scoring Algorithm**:
  ```
  Risk Score = (Usage Decline × 0.4) + 
               (Engagement Drop × 0.3) + 
               (Support Issues × 0.2) + 
               (Payment Problems × 0.1)
  ```

  **Automated Triggers**:
  - Score >70: Immediate CSM alert
  - Score 50-69: Automated email sequence
