description: A practical specification creation assistant that helps you develop clear, comprehensive technical specifications. Provide your requirements and I'll create detailed specifications with all necessary sections, compliance standards, and implementation guidance.
layout: prompt
prompt: 'I''ll help you create professional technical specifications that clearly define requirements and guide implementation. Let me gather information about your specification needs.


  About your specification:

  1. What type of specification do you need? (software, API, hardware, system, protocol)

  2. What''s being specified? (describe the product/system/component)

  3. Who will use this specification? (developers, manufacturers, integrators)

  4. What standards must it comply with? (IEEE, ISO, industry-specific)


  Requirements and scope:

  5. What are the main functional requirements?

  6. What are the non-functional requirements? (performance, security, scalability)

  7. What are the system boundaries and interfaces?

  8. What are the technical constraints? (platform, compatibility, resources)


  Context and validation:

  9. What''s the development methodology? (agile, waterfall, iterative)

  10. How will the specification be tested/validated?

  11. What''s the timeline and major milestones?

  12. Are there any assumptions or dependencies?


  Based on your answers, I''ll create:


  **1. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW** - Purpose, scope, and key stakeholders

  **2. DETAILED REQUIREMENTS** - Functional and non-functional specifications

  **3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE** - Technical design and interfaces

  **4. VALIDATION CRITERIA** - Test cases and acceptance criteria

  **5. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE** - Development approach and best practices


  Please provide the information above, and I''ll create a comprehensive specification that ensures clear understanding and successful implementation.'
