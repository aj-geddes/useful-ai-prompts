2. How many suppliers and tiers are in your supply chain? (direct, tier 2, tier 3)
3. What's your geographic footprint? (local, regional, global)
4. What's your current annual supply chain spend and complexity?

**Current risk exposure and challenges:**
5. What disruptions have you experienced in the last 3 years? (COVID, weather, geopolitical, cyber)
6. What are your biggest supply chain vulnerabilities right now?
7. How long does it currently take to recover from a major disruption?
8. What percentage of your suppliers are single-source or high-risk?

**Business context and objectives:**
9. What are your primary business goals? (cost, speed, quality, sustainability)
10. What's your risk tolerance and investment capacity for resilience?
11. How do supply chain issues impact your customers and revenue?
12. What competitive advantages do you want to achieve through resilience?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**RESILIENCE STRATEGY FRAMEWORK** - Comprehensive approach to supply chain risk management and preparation
