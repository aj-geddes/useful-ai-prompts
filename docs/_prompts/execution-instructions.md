prompt: "# Execution Instructions for AI Prompt Research Assistant\n\nThe following instructions guide the continuous research and development of useful AI prompts for the GitHub repository at https://github.com/aj-geddes/useful-ai-prompts.\n\n## Initialization Process\n\n1. Begin by creating a project research index:\n   - Read the job categories, workflow categories, thinking approaches, and persona profiles\n   - Create a prioritization matrix based on potential impact and utility\n   - Establish initial research focus areas\n\n2. For each research cycle:\n   ```\n   CYCLE_ID=\"PROMPT-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)\"\n   TARGET_DOMAIN=[Select from job categories]\n   TARGET_WORKFLOW=[Select from workflow categories]\n   THINKING_APPROACH=[Select 1-2 from thinking approaches]\n   PRIMARY_PERSONA=[Select from persona profiles]\n   SECONDARY_PERSONA=[Optional: Select complementary persona]\n   ```\n\n## Research Loop\n\nFor each prompt development cycle, execute this research loop:\n\n1. **Domain\
  \ & Workflow Analysis**\n\n   ```\n   Research current best practices for $TARGET_DOMAIN in $TARGET_WORKFLOW\n   Identify key challenges and pain points\n   Document workflow steps and decision points\n   Research existing prompt approaches for similar tasks\n   ```\n\n2. **Persona & Thinking Layer Integration**\n\n   ```\n   Apply $PRIMARY_PERSONA perspective to workflow challenges\n   Layer with $THINKING_APPROACH methodology\n   If $SECONDARY_PERSONA defined, integrate complementary viewpoint\n   Create initial prompt structure with layered instructions\n   ```\n\n3. **Prompt Development**\n\n   ```\n   Draft prompt with:\n    - Clear context setting\n    - Persona-specific instruction layer\n    - Thinking methodology guidance\n    - Output format specifications\n    - Examples where appropriate\n   Add customization variables using {{placeholder}} syntax\n   Include safeguards and guardrails\n   ```\n\n4. **Testing & Refinement**\n\n   ```\n   Test prompt against sample scenarios\n\
  \   Identify edge cases and limitations\n   Refine language for clarity and effectiveness\n   Add usage instructions and examples\n   Document research findings\n   ```\n\n5. **Documentation & Commit**\n\n   ```\n   Create prompt file following repository structure:\n     prompts/$CATEGORY/$SUBCATEGORY/$PROMPT_NAME.md\n\n   Complete all metadata fields\n   Add comprehensive usage instructions\n   Include concrete examples\n   Document research findings\n\n   Commit with message:\n   \"Add $PROMPT_NAME: $BRIEF_DESCRIPTION\"\n   ```\n\n6. **Cross-Reference & Index Update**\n   ```\n   Update related prompts with cross-references\n   Add to appropriate index files\n   Tag with relevant categories for searchability\n   ```\n\n## Selection Criteria\n\nWhen selecting job and workflow combinations to prioritize:\n\n1. **High-Impact Areas**:\n   - Frequently performed workflows with significant time investment\n   - Tasks requiring complex cognitive processes\n   - Areas where AI assistance can\
  \ provide substantial value\n   - Workflows with clear inputs and outputs\n\n2. **Layering Strategy**:\n   - Pair analytical personas with creative workflows\n   - Layer strategic thinking with tactical execution\n   - Combine domain expertise with methodological frameworks\n   - Create unexpected but valuable combinations\n\n3. **Progressive Development**:\n   - Start with foundational prompts for common workflows\n   - Build toward specialized, niche applications\n   - Develop prompt chains for complex processes\n   - Create meta-prompts that help develop other prompts\n\n## Continuous Research Focuses\n\nMaintain ongoing research in these key areas:\n\n1. **Prompt Effectiveness**:\n   - Techniques for improving response quality\n   - Methods for handling edge cases\n   - Approaches for maintaining context in complex workflows\n   - Strategies for optimizing different thinking layers\n\n2. **Taxonomy Development**:\n   - Refine categorization system\n   - Develop cross-cutting tags for\
  \ better discoverability\n   - Identify emerging workflow patterns\n   - Create relationship maps between prompts\n\n3. **Use Case Expansion**:\n   - Identify new professional domains\n   - Discover emerging workflow needs\n   - Research novel applications of AI assistance\n   - Document real-world implementation examples\n\n## Output Standards\n\nEvery prompt must meet these standards:\n\n1. **Utility**: Solves a specific, practical problem\n2. **Clarity**: Instructions clear enough for consistent results\n3. **Adaptability**: Includes customization points\n4. **Documentation**: Complete usage instructions and examples\n5. **Layering**: Incorporates multiple thinking approaches\n6. **Personalization**: Leverages relevant persona perspectives\n7. **Reproducibility**: Produces consistent results when used as directed\n8. **Originality**: Offers unique value not found in existing prompts\n\n## Commit Cycle\n\nFor each new prompt:\n\n1. Create file following naming convention:\n\n   ```\n\
  \   prompts/<domain>/<workflow>/<approach>-<persona>-<task>.md\n   ```\n\n2. Complete prompt template with all required sections:\n\n   ```markdown\n   # [Prompt Title]\n\n   ## Metadata\n\n   - **Category**: [Primary Category]\n   - **Tags**: [comma, separated, relevant, tags]\n   - **Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD]\n   - **Version**: [X.Y.Z]\n   - **Personas**: [Primary persona, Secondary persona]\n   - **Use Cases**: [comma separated use cases]\n   - **Compatible Models**: [list of compatible models]\n\n   ## Description\n\n   [Clear explanation of the prompt's purpose and context]\n\n   ## Prompt Template\n   ```\n\n   [Actual prompt text with {{placeholders}} for customization]\n\n   ```\n\n   ## Usage Instructions\n   [Step-by-step guidance on effective use]\n\n   ## Examples\n   ### Example 1: [Brief description]\n   **Input**: [Sample input]\n   **Output**: [Example of expected output]\n\n   ## Related Prompts\n   [Links to related prompts]\n\n   ## Research Notes\n   [Insights from testing\
  \ and development]\n   ```\n\n3. Commit with descriptive message\n\n4. Continue to next prompt in the development cycle\n\n## Weekly Progress Report\n\nGenerate a weekly summary including:\n\n- Number of new prompts created\n- Domains and workflows covered\n- Emerging patterns and insights\n- Recommendations for next focus areas\n- Statistics on prompt categories and distributions"
