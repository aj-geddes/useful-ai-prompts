  I'll help you establish a systematic framework for researching and developing useful AI prompts. Let me understand your objectives:

  ## Understanding Your Prompt Development Goals

  **Research Focus:**
  - What domains or professional fields are you targeting? (technical, business, creative, academic)
  - Which workflows or tasks need the most AI assistance in your organization?
  - Are you building prompts for general use or specific teams/roles?
  - What pain points or inefficiencies are you trying to address?

  **Quality Standards:**
  - What defines a "successful" prompt in your context?
  - How will you measure prompt effectiveness? (time savings, quality of output, user satisfaction)
  - Do you have specific format or structure requirements?
  - Are there compliance or security considerations for prompt content?

  **Development Approach:**
  - How many prompts do you aim to develop? (weekly/monthly targets)
  - Do you want to focus on depth (specialized prompts) or breadth (many domains)?
  - Will prompts be developed iteratively based on feedback?
  - Do you need versioning and change tracking?

  **Organizational Context:**
  - Who will be using these prompts? (developers, managers, analysts, creatives)
  - How will prompts be organized and discovered?
  - Do you need integration with specific tools or platforms?
  - What documentation standards should be followed?

  - Innovation opportunity discovery processes

  ## 2. Development Workflow

  Step-by-step procedures for:
  - Selecting high-impact use cases
  - Combining persona perspectives with thinking methodologies
  - Drafting prompts with clear structure and examples
  - Testing against sample scenarios
  - Refining based on edge cases
  - Documentation and metadata completion

  ## 3. Prompt Structure Templates

  Standardized formats for:
  - Context setting and objective clarity
  - Persona-specific instruction layers
  - Thinking methodology guidance
  - Output format specifications
  - Customization variables using placeholders
  - Safeguards and guardrails
  - Usage instructions and examples

  ## 4. Selection Criteria Framework

  Guidelines for prioritizing:
  - High-impact workflows with significant time investment
  - Tasks requiring complex cognitive processes
  - Areas where AI provides substantial value
  - Workflows with clear inputs and outputs
  - Progressive development from foundational to specialized

  ## 5. Quality Standards Checklist

  Validation criteria ensuring each prompt has:

  - Layering: Incorporates multiple thinking approaches
  - Personalization: Leverages relevant persona perspectives
  - Reproducibility: Produces consistent results
  - Originality: Offers unique value

  ## 6. Repository Organization System

  File structure and naming conventions:
  - Category-based directory organization
  - Consistent naming patterns (domain-workflow-approach-task)
  - Metadata standards (tags, version, use cases, compatible models)
  - Cross-referencing and relationship mapping
  - Index maintenance procedures

  ## 7. Testing and Validation Process

  Methods for ensuring quality:
  - Sample scenario testing
  - Edge case identification
  - Output consistency verification
  - User acceptance testing
  - Continuous improvement cycles

  ## 8. Research Tracking System

  Documentation for:
  - Development cycle logs
  - Research findings and insights
  - Testing results and refinements
  - Usage patterns and feedback
  - Performance metrics and trends

  ## 9. Knowledge Management

  Systems for:
  - Taxonomy development and refinement
  - Cross-cutting tag systems for discoverability
  - Emerging pattern identification
  - Relationship maps between prompts
  - Use case expansion strategies

  ## 10. Progress Reporting

  Regular summaries including:
  - Prompts created and domains covered
  - Emerging patterns and insights
  - Recommendations for focus areas
  - Statistics and distribution metrics
  - Quality trends and improvements
