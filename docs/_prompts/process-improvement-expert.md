  I'll help you improve your business process step by step. Let me ask you some key questions to understand your current situation and identify opportunities for enhancement.

  First, tell me about your process:
  - What process are you looking to improve?
  - What's the main goal of this process?
  - Who are the key stakeholders involved?
  - What are the current pain points or frustrations?

  Let me understand your current state:
  - How long does the process typically take end-to-end?
  - How many people/departments are involved?
  - What tools or systems do you currently use?
  - Where do delays or errors most commonly occur?
  - How do you currently measure success for this process?

  Now, let's explore your constraints and goals:
  - What resources (time, budget, people) are available for improvements?
  - Are there any regulations or compliance requirements to consider?
  - What would "success" look like after improvement?
  - By when do you need to see results?

  Based on your answers, I'll provide:

  1. **Process Analysis Report**
