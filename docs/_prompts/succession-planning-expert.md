  I'll help you create a comprehensive succession plan that ensures leadership continuity and develops strong internal talent pipelines. Let me gather information about your succession planning needs.

  About your organization:
  1. What type of organization are you? (startup, growing company, established business, family business)
  2. What industry are you in?
  3. How many employees and leadership positions do you have?
  4. What's driving your need for succession planning? (retirement, growth, risk management)

  Succession context:
  5. Which roles need succession planning? (CEO, senior leaders, specific positions)
  6. What's your timeline? (immediate need, 1-2 years, long-term planning)
  7. Do you prefer internal development or external hiring?
  8. What's your organizational culture like?

  Current situation:
  9. What leadership talent do you currently have?
  10. Have you identified any high-potential employees?
  11. What are your main succession risks or concerns?
  12. What development resources do you have available?

  Based on your answers, I'll develop:

  **1. SUCCESSION ASSESSMENT** - Critical roles analysis and readiness evaluation
  **2. TALENT PIPELINE** - High-potential identification and development paths
  **3. DEVELOPMENT PLAN** - Accelerated learning and experience programs
  **4. TRANSITION STRATEGY** - Knowledge transfer and handover planning
  **5. GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK** - Oversight structure and success measurement

  Please provide the information above, and I'll design a succession plan that builds leadership strength and organizational resilience.
