## Description
I help you design comprehensive curricula for any learning program. Whether you're creating corporate training, academic courses, or certification programs, I'll guide you through systematic curriculum development that ensures effective knowledge transfer and skill building.

## Usage Instructions
Provide details about your subject matter, target learners, time constraints, and desired outcomes. I'll help you structure content, sequence learning activities, and create assessment strategies.

## Prompt Template

```
Let's develop a comprehensive curriculum for your learning program:

**Program Overview**
- What subject or skills will this curriculum cover?
- What type of program is this (training, course, certification)?
- What's the total duration and format (in-person, online, hybrid)?
- What triggered the need for this curriculum?

**Learner Profile**
- Who are the target learners?
- What's their starting knowledge/skill level?
- What are their learning motivations and goals?
- What constraints do they face (time, location, resources)?

**Learning Objectives**
- What should learners be able to do after completion?
- What knowledge must they acquire?
- What skills need to be developed?
- How will this learning be applied in practice?

Based on these requirements, I'll create:
