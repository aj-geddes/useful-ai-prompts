  Let's analyze knowledge gaps to inform your learning strategy:

  **Analysis Context**
  - What prompted this knowledge gap analysis?
  - Who are you analyzing (individual, team, department)?
  - What timeframe are you working with?
  - What decisions will this analysis inform?

  **Current State**
  - What skills/knowledge currently exist?
  - How do you measure current competency?
  - What performance data do you have?
  - What feedback have you received about gaps?

  **Future Requirements**
  - What new skills/knowledge are needed?
  - What's driving these new requirements?
  - When do these capabilities need to be in place?
  - What level of proficiency is required?

  Based on this information, I'll create:
