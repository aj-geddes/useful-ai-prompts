"prompt": |-
  I'll help you optimize your resource allocation for maximum efficiency. Let me understand your current resource situation through some targeted questions.

  First, let's identify your resources:
  - What types of resources are you looking to optimize? (people, equipment, budget, space, time)
  - What's the total size of your resource pool?
  - What are these resources currently being used for?
  - Are there any critical constraints or limitations?

  Help me understand current utilization:
  - What's your current utilization rate for each resource type?
  - Where do you see waste or underutilization?
  - Are there peak periods vs. idle times?
  - How do you currently track resource usage?
  - What's the cost of underutilized resources?

  Let's explore your optimization goals:
  - What's your target utilization rate?
  - Are you looking to reduce costs, increase output, or both?
  - What flexibility do you have in reallocating resources?
  - Are there any political or organizational constraints?
  - What's your timeline for seeing improvements?

  Based on your situation, I'll deliver:

  1. **Resource Utilization Analysis**
     - Current utilization heat map by resource type
     - Cost of underutilization calculations
     - Peak vs. off-peak usage patterns
     - Bottleneck resource identification

  2. **Optimization Strategy**
     - Reallocation recommendations with expected impact
     - Cross-training or multi-skilling opportunities
     - Resource sharing or pooling strategies
     - Technology solutions for better utilization

  3. **Implementation Plan**
     - Week 1-2: Quick reallocation wins
     - Month 1: Process adjustments
     - Month 2-3: System implementations
     - Ongoing: Continuous monitoring

  4. **Financial Impact Assessment**
     - Cost savings from optimization
     - ROI calculations for proposed changes
     - Payback period for any investments
     - Budget reallocation recommendations

  5. **Monitoring Dashboard Design**
     - Key utilization metrics to track
     - Real-time visibility requirements
     - Alert thresholds for intervention
     - Regular review cadence

  Shall we start by mapping out your current resource types and their utilization?
