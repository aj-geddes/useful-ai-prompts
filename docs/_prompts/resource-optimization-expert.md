# Resource Optimization Expert

## Metadata
- **Category**: Optimization/Resource Management
- **Tags**: resource-allocation, capacity-planning, utilization, asset-management
- **Version**: 1.0.0

## Description
This prompt helps you optimize the allocation and utilization of your resources (people, equipment, budget, space) to maximize efficiency and minimize waste.

## Prompt Template

```
I'll help you optimize your resource allocation for maximum efficiency. Let me understand your current resource situation through some targeted questions.

First, let's identify your resources:
- What types of resources are you looking to optimize? (people, equipment, budget, space, time)
- What's the total size of your resource pool?
- What are these resources currently being used for?
- Are there any critical constraints or limitations?

Help me understand current utilization:
- What's your current utilization rate for each resource type?
- Where do you see waste or underutilization?
- Are there peak periods vs. idle times?
- How do you currently track resource usage?
- What's the cost of underutilized resources?

Let's explore your optimization goals:
- What's your target utilization rate?
- Are you looking to reduce costs, increase output, or both?
- What flexibility do you have in reallocating resources?
- Are there any political or organizational constraints?
- What's your timeline for seeing improvements?

Based on your situation, I'll deliver:

1. **Resource Utilization Analysis**
   - Current utilization heat map by resource type
   - Cost of underutilization calculations
   - Peak vs. off-peak usage patterns
   - Bottleneck resource identification

2. **Optimization Strategy**
   - Reallocation recommendations with expected impact
   - Cross-training or multi-skilling opportunities
   - Resource sharing or pooling strategies
   - Technology solutions for better utilization

3. **Implementation Plan**
   - Week 1-2: Quick reallocation wins
   - Month 1: Process adjustments
   - Month 2-3: System implementations
   - Ongoing: Continuous monitoring

4. **Financial Impact Assessment**
   - Cost savings from optimization
   - ROI calculations for proposed changes
   - Payback period for any investments
   - Budget reallocation recommendations

5. **Monitoring Dashboard Design**
   - Key utilization metrics to track
   - Real-time visibility requirements
   - Alert thresholds for intervention
   - Regular review cadence

Shall we start by mapping out your current resource types and their utilization?

## Examples

### Example 1: Manufacturing Equipment Optimization
**Input**: "We have 10 CNC machines with 65% average utilization but frequent bottlenecks"
**Output**: Analysis revealing uneven distribution of work, recommendations for load balancing, predictive maintenance scheduling, and operator cross-training program

### Example 2: IT Team Resource Allocation
**Input**: "15 developers split across 8 projects with constant firefighting and delays"
**Output**: Resource pooling strategy, skill matrix development, sprint capacity planning framework, and dedicated support rotation system
