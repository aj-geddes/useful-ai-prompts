description: A practical prototyping guide that helps you quickly test and validate
  ideas through systematic prototyping. Provide your concept and constraints, and
  I'll guide you through creating effective prototypes.
examples:
- input: '1. Concept: Mobile app for parents to track and share their baby''s developmental
    milestones

    2. Key assumptions: Parents want to track milestones, they''ll share with family,
    they''ll pay for premium features

    3. Target users: New parents (0-2 year olds), tech-comfortable, 25-40 years old

    4. Stage: Early concept, have some mockups but no functionality


    5. Budget: $2,000 for prototyping

    6. Timeline: Need validation in 4 weeks

    7. Skills/tools: Figma for design, can do basic no-code apps, no developers yet

    8. User access: Can reach 20-30 parents through parenting groups


    9. Need to learn: Will parents actually use this daily? What features are must-have
    vs nice-to-have?

    10. Success: Clear evidence parents would use and pay for this, validated feature
    set'
  output: 'Core Assumptions:

    □ Parents track milestones (Target: 70% add 3+ in week)

    □ They share with family (Target: 50% share at least once)

    □ They''ll pay for premium (Target: 30% show strong interest)


    Must-Have Features (need 80%+ validation):

    □ Quick milestone capture

    □ Photo organization

    □ Growth timeline

    □ Family sharing


    Nice-to-Have Features (need 50%+ interest):

    □ Development tips

    □ Milestone reminders

    □ Comparison charts

    □ Doctor reports'

prompt: 'I''ll help you create an effective prototyping strategy to test and validate
  your idea quickly. Let me gather information to design the right approach.


  About your concept:

  1. What are you trying to prototype? (product, service, app, process, etc.)

  2. What key assumptions need testing?

  3. Who are your target users?

  4. What stage are you at? (early concept, feature validation, pre-launch)


  About your resources:

  5. What''s your budget for prototyping?

  6. How much time do you have?

  7. What skills/tools do you have available?

  8. How many users can you access for testing?


  About your goals:

  9. What do you need to learn from this prototype?

  10. What would make this prototype successful?


  Based on your answers, I''ll provide:


  **1. PROTOTYPE STRATEGY** - Right fidelity level and approach for your needs

  **2. BUILD PLAN** - Step-by-step guide to create your prototype

  **3. TESTING PROTOCOL** - How to test effectively with users

  **4. LEARNING FRAMEWORK** - How to capture and act on insights

  **5. ITERATION ROADMAP** - Next steps based on different outcomes


  I''ll recommend specific prototyping methods:

  - Paper/Sketch prototypes (hours to create)

  - Digital mockups (days to create)

  - Functional prototypes (weeks to create)

  - Wizard of Oz (simulate functionality)

  - Concierge MVP (manual service delivery)


  Please provide the information above for your customized prototyping plan.'
