# Prototyping Coach

## Metadata

- **Category**: Creativity & Innovation
- **Tags**: prototyping, rapid validation, MVP, user testing, iterative design
- **Created**: 2025-07-21
- **Version**: 2.0.0
- **Use Cases**: product development, service design, concept validation, user testing
- **Compatible Models**: GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini Pro, GPT-3.5

## Description

A practical prototyping guide that helps you quickly test and validate ideas through systematic prototyping. Provide your concept and constraints, and I'll guide you through creating effective prototypes.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you create an effective prototyping strategy to test and validate your idea quickly. Let me gather information to design the right approach.

About your concept:
1. What are you trying to prototype? (product, service, app, process, etc.)
2. What key assumptions need testing?
3. Who are your target users?
4. What stage are you at? (early concept, feature validation, pre-launch)

About your resources:
5. What's your budget for prototyping?
6. How much time do you have?
7. What skills/tools do you have available?
8. How many users can you access for testing?

About your goals:
9. What do you need to learn from this prototype?
10. What would make this prototype successful?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**1. PROTOTYPE STRATEGY** - Right fidelity level and approach for your needs
**2. BUILD PLAN** - Step-by-step guide to create your prototype
**3. TESTING PROTOCOL** - How to test effectively with users
**4. LEARNING FRAMEWORK** - How to capture and act on insights
**5. ITERATION ROADMAP** - Next steps based on different outcomes

I'll recommend specific prototyping methods:
- Paper/Sketch prototypes (hours to create)
- Digital mockups (days to create)
- Functional prototypes (weeks to create)
- Wizard of Oz (simulate functionality)
- Concierge MVP (manual service delivery)

Please provide the information above for your customized prototyping plan.
```

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Concept: Mobile app for parents to track and share their baby's developmental milestones
2. Key assumptions: Parents want to track milestones, they'll share with family, they'll pay for premium features
3. Target users: New parents (0-2 year olds), tech-comfortable, 25-40 years old
4. Stage: Early concept, have some mockups but no functionality

5. Budget: $2,000 for prototyping
6. Timeline: Need validation in 4 weeks
7. Skills/tools: Figma for design, can do basic no-code apps, no developers yet
8. User access: Can reach 20-30 parents through parenting groups

9. Need to learn: Will parents actually use this daily? What features are must-have vs nice-to-have?
10. Success: Clear evidence parents would use and pay for this, validated feature set
```

**Assistant Output:**

Perfect! Let's create a smart prototyping strategy that validates your baby milestone tracker within 4 weeks and $2,000. Here's your plan:

**PROTOTYPE STRATEGY**

Given your timeline and validation needs, I recommend a **two-phase approach**:

**Phase 1: Interactive Mockup (Week 1-2)**
- Tool: Figma with prototype links
- Fidelity: Medium - looks real, limited functionality
- Cost: $0 (using existing tools)
- Purpose: Test core value prop and UI

**Phase 2: Hybrid MVP (Week 3-4)**  
- Tool: No-code app (Bubble/Glide) + manual backend
- Fidelity: High - working app with "Wizard of Oz" elements
- Cost: $200 for tools + $1,800 for incentives/testing
- Purpose: Test actual usage behavior

**BUILD PLAN**

**Week 1: Interactive Mockup**
1. **Core Screens** (2 days)
   - Milestone tracking dashboard
   - Add milestone flow (photo, date, notes)
   - Family sharing screen
   - Settings/premium features

2. **Prototype Links** (1 day)
   - Connect screens with realistic flows
   - Add micro-interactions
   - Create 3 key user journeys

3. **Test Content** (1 day)
   - Pre-populate with realistic data
   - Include 10-15 common milestones
   - Add sample family members

**Week 2: No-Code MVP**
1. **Basic App Setup** (2 days)
   - Use Glide or Bubble
   - Set up user accounts
   - Create milestone database

2. **Core Features** (2 days)
   - Milestone entry form
   - Photo upload
   - Basic timeline view
   - Simple sharing (email/link)

3. **"Wizard of Oz" Features** (1 day)
   - Premium recommendations (manually sent)
   - Milestone reminders (manual texts)
   - Development insights (curated content)

**TESTING PROTOCOL**

**Round 1: Concept Validation (Week 2)**
- **Participants**: 10 parents
- **Method**: 30-min video calls
- **Script**:
  1. Context questions (5 min)
  2. Task-based testing (15 min)
  3. Feature prioritization (5 min)
  4. Pricing discussion (5 min)

**Key Tasks**:
- "Add your baby's first smile"
- "Share with grandparents"  
- "Check development progress"
- "Explore premium features"

**Round 2: Behavior Testing (Week 4)**
- **Participants**: 20 parents
- **Method**: 1-week real usage
- **Process**:
  1. Onboard with video call
  2. Daily check-ins via text
  3. Track actual usage
  4. Exit interview

**Metrics to Track**:
- Daily active usage rate
- Number of milestones added
- Sharing actions taken
- Feature requests
- Drop-off points

**LEARNING FRAMEWORK**

**Validation Scorecard**:
```
Core Assumptions:
□ Parents track milestones (Target: 70% add 3+ in week)
□ They share with family (Target: 50% share at least once)
□ They'll pay for premium (Target: 30% show strong interest)

Must-Have Features (need 80%+ validation):
□ Quick milestone capture
□ Photo organization
□ Growth timeline
□ Family sharing

Nice-to-Have Features (need 50%+ interest):
□ Development tips
□ Milestone reminders
□ Comparison charts
□ Doctor reports
```

**Data Collection Template**:
- User ID | Milestones Added | Days Active | Shared? | Premium Interest | Key Quote

**ITERATION ROADMAP**

**If Validation is STRONG (>70% on all metrics):**
1. Proceed to full development
2. Focus on must-have features only
3. Launch beta with tested users
4. Raise funding with validation data

**If Validation is MIXED (40-70%):**
1. Pivot problem focus (maybe it's about sharing, not tracking?)
2. Test different user segment (grandparents?)
3. Simplify feature set dramatically
4. Re-test with adjusted concept

**If Validation is WEAK (<40%):**
1. Conduct deeper problem interviews
2. Explore adjacent problems (baby photos? health tracking?)
3. Consider different solution approach
4. Test willingness to pay for current solutions

**BUDGET BREAKDOWN**
- No-code tools: $200
- User incentives: $30 x 30 users = $900
- Testing tools (Calendly, Zoom): $100
- Contingency: $800
- **Total: $2,000**

**QUICK WINS TO START TODAY**
1. Set up Figma file with component library
2. Join 3 parenting Facebook groups for recruiting
3. Create testing calendar and book first sessions
4. Draft milestone list from development guides

Would you like me to detail any specific part, like the testing script or help you plan the no-code app structure?
