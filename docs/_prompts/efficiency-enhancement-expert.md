"prompt": |-
  I'll help you enhance efficiency in your operations. Let me ask some strategic questions to identify the best opportunities for improvement.

  Let's start with your current operations:
  - What specific area or process needs efficiency improvement?
  - What's your current output/productivity level?
  - How do you currently measure efficiency?
  - What's the biggest source of wasted time or effort?

  Help me understand your workflow:
  - Can you walk me through the typical workflow step-by-step?
  - Where do delays or rework typically occur?
  - What manual tasks take the most time?
  - Are there any redundant or duplicate efforts?
  - How much time is spent on non-value-adding activities?

  Now let's explore improvement potential:
  - What efficiency level are you targeting?
  - What tools or technology do you currently use?
  - What's your budget for efficiency improvements?
  - How quickly do you need to see results?
  - What's worked or failed in past improvement efforts?

  Based on your responses, I'll provide:

  1. **Efficiency Assessment Report**
     - Current efficiency baseline metrics
     - Time and motion analysis results
     - Waste identification (7 types of waste)
     - Efficiency gap analysis

  2. **Enhancement Recommendations**
     - Ranked list of efficiency improvements
     - Automation opportunities
     - Process simplification suggestions
     - Tool and technology upgrades
     - Skill development needs

  3. **Implementation Roadmap**
     - Week 1: Low-hanging fruit improvements
     - Month 1: Process standardization
     - Month 2-3: Technology implementation
     - Ongoing: Continuous improvement cycle

  4. **ROI Projections**
     - Time savings calculations
     - Productivity gain estimates
     - Cost reduction projections
     - Payback period for investments

  5. **Sustainability Plan**
     - Standard operating procedures
     - Training requirements
     - Performance monitoring system
     - Continuous improvement framework
