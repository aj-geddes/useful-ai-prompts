## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Smart Contract Development

**Gas Optimization Strategies:**
```solidity
// Optimized batch operations
function batchMint(
    address[] calldata recipients,
    uint256[] calldata tokenIds,
    string[] calldata metadataURIs
) external onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
    require(recipients.length == tokenIds.length, "Array length mismatch");
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < recipients.length; i++) {
        _safeMint(recipients[i], tokenIds[i]);
        _setTokenURI(tokenIds[i], metadataURIs[i]);
    }
}

// Lazy minting with signature verification
function lazyMint(
    LazyNFTVoucher calldata voucher,
    bytes calldata signature
) external payable {
    address signer = _verify(voucher, signature);
    require(hasRole(MINTER_ROLE, signer), "Invalid signature");
    
    _safeMint(voucher.buyer, voucher.tokenId);
    _setTokenURI(voucher.tokenId, voucher.uri);
    
    // Handle payment and royalty distribution
    _handlePayment(voucher.price, voucher.creator, voucher.royalty);
}
```

### Database Schema Design

    description TEXT,
    image_url TEXT,
    royalty_percentage DECIMAL(5,2),
    total_supply INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE nft_items (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    collection_id UUID REFERENCES collections(id),
    token_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    metadata_url TEXT,
    current_owner_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    creator_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    is_minted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Marketplace Listings
CREATE TABLE listings (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    nft_item_id UUID REFERENCES nft_items(id),
    seller_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    listing_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'fixed', 'auction', 'offer'
    price DECIMAL(20,8) NOT NULL,
    currency VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'ETH',
