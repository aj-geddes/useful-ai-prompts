layout: prompt
prompt: 'Teach me the following technology in a structured, source-driven format.


  - Technology: [INSERT NAME]

  - Domain: [E.G., INFRASTRUCTURE AUTOMATION, API SECURITY, SYSTEMS MONITORING]

  - Skill Level: [NOVICE | PROFICIENT | ADVANCED]

  - Learning Objectives: [E.G., IMPLEMENT A MINIMAL DEPLOYMENT, CONDUCT PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKING, EXTEND SDK FUNCTIONALITY]

  - Time Horizon: [E.G., 3-DAY INTENSIVE, MONTH-LONG EVALUATION]

  - System Integrations: [LIST ALL ENVIRONMENTAL DEPENDENCIES]

  - Constraints/Preferences: [E.G., FOSS TOOLS ONLY, NO GUI DEPENDENCIES, FAVOR PYTHON OR BASH]


  Instructions:

  1. Present a concise overview of the technology’s design intent, domain fit, and technical lineage.

  2. Enumerate primary capabilities, use cases, and supported abstractions.

  3. Deconstruct the core architecture, API models, and configuration semantics.

  4. Propose a time-bound, role-aligned learning sequence that aligns with the stated goals.

  5. Include curated references to official documentation, example repositories, and community guides.

  6. Highlight typical anti-patterns, deployment caveats, and version-specific issues.

  7. Conclude with a checklist of knowledge validation steps and testable artifacts.


  Response Constraints:

  - Maintain Temperature 0 tone: fully objective, rigorously sourced

  - Ensure modularity and progressive complexity

  - Validate all information against official upstream sources

  - Align pedagogical outputs with the learner’s goals and environmental constraints'
