# Research-Oriented Technology Learning Framework

## Define the Learning Scope

To initiate a structured, verifiable, and domain-specific learning track for an unfamiliar technology, the following parameters must be clearly articulated:

- **Technology Name**: Specify the tool, library, language, or platform to be explored.
- **Operational Domain**: Define the scope of relevance (e.g., distributed systems telemetry, infrastructure as code, cryptographic key management, event-driven architecture).
- **Baseline Proficiency**: Self-assess current technical fluency with related systems (e.g., novice, competent, expert).
- **Target Learning Outcomes**: Articulate clear objectives (e.g., deployment of a reference implementation, architectural pattern evaluation, API surface area mastery).
- **Temporal Scope**: Specify the available duration or urgency of the learning initiative (e.g., accelerated 5-day immersion, 4-week evaluation cycle).
- **Integration Landscape**: List known systems or components this technology must interface with (e.g., GitHub Actions, AWS IAM, Kubernetes, Postgres).
- **Constraints and Priorities**: Declare technical constraints, learning modality preferences, or compliance considerations (e.g., open source only, Python-based SDKs, CLI-first access).

---

## Pedagogical Standards and Structural Expectations

- **Empirical Orientation (Temperature 0)**: All instructional content must be objective, fact-based, and directly sourced from authoritative documentation.
- **Conceptual Progression**: Curriculum design must advance from fundamentals through implementation and evaluation.
- **Applied Context Alignment**: All exercises, examples, and guidance must map to the learner’s specified integration and operational context.
- **Primary Source Fidelity**: Instructional assertions must be cross-referenced to standards, canonical documentation, or community-vetted artifacts.
- **Toolchain Comprehension**: Learners must be introduced to associated development interfaces including SDKs, CLIs, configuration layers, and testing frameworks.

## Temperature 0 LLM-Compatible Learning Prompt

```text
Teach me the following technology in a structured, source-driven format.

- Technology: [INSERT NAME]
- Domain: [E.G., INFRASTRUCTURE AUTOMATION, API SECURITY, SYSTEMS MONITORING]
- Skill Level: [NOVICE | PROFICIENT | ADVANCED]
- Learning Objectives: [E.G., IMPLEMENT A MINIMAL DEPLOYMENT, CONDUCT PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKING, EXTEND SDK FUNCTIONALITY]
- Time Horizon: [E.G., 3-DAY INTENSIVE, MONTH-LONG EVALUATION]
- System Integrations: [LIST ALL ENVIRONMENTAL DEPENDENCIES]
- Constraints/Preferences: [E.G., FOSS TOOLS ONLY, NO GUI DEPENDENCIES, FAVOR PYTHON OR BASH]

Instructions:
1. Present a concise overview of the technology’s design intent, domain fit, and technical lineage.
2. Enumerate primary capabilities, use cases, and supported abstractions.
3. Deconstruct the core architecture, API models, and configuration semantics.
4. Propose a time-bound, role-aligned learning sequence that aligns with the stated goals.
5. Include curated references to official documentation, example repositories, and community guides.
6. Highlight typical anti-patterns, deployment caveats, and version-specific issues.
7. Conclude with a checklist of knowledge validation steps and testable artifacts.

Response Constraints:
- Maintain Temperature 0 tone: fully objective, rigorously sourced
- Ensure modularity and progressive complexity
- Validate all information against official upstream sources
- Align pedagogical outputs with the learner’s goals and environmental constraints
```

## Instructional Deliverables

- `learning-plan.md`: Time-sequenced curriculum detailing milestones, checkpoints, and reference artifacts
- `reference-index.md`: Curated bibliography of official documentation, ecosystem tools, and verified tutorials
- `integration-checklist.md`: Platform-specific guide for validating operational readiness and integration viability

---

## Evaluation and Completion Criteria

- ✅ Conceptual overview is accurate, succinct, and source-anchored
- ✅ Learning plan is tailored to skill level and operational objective
- ✅ All references are verifiable and contextually relevant
- ✅ Instructional outputs are suitable for internal documentation or onboarding assets
- ✅ Learner can demonstrate acquired competence through reproducible outcomes

---

## Quality Assurance Standards

- **Instructional Neutrality**: Content must remain free of vendor preference, opinion, or extrapolation
- **Progressive Complexity**: Learning materials must scale in sophistication and depth
- **System Awareness**: Instruction must reflect operational and architectural integration constraints
- **Citeability**: All guidance must include traceable source references
- **ADR Compatibility**: Learning artifacts may optionally inform architectural evaluation processes or decision support documentation
