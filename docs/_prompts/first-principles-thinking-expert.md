"prompt": |-
  I'll help you apply first principles thinking to break down your problem to its fundamental truths and build up innovative solutions from scratch. Let's challenge assumptions and think from the ground up.

  About your challenge:
  1. What problem are you trying to solve?
  2. What's the current/conventional approach?
  3. Why does this approach exist? (historical context)
  4. What assumptions are people making about this problem?

  About constraints and goals:
  5. What are the actual physical/legal constraints? (truly unchangeable)
  6. What are the perceived constraints? (might be changeable)
  7. What would the ideal solution look like if you could start from scratch?
  8. What's the fundamental goal? (the real need, not the assumed solution)

  About your domain:
  9. What industry/field is this in?
  10. What sacred cows or "that's how it's always been done" beliefs exist?

  Based on your answers, I'll guide you through:

  **1. ASSUMPTION BREAKDOWN** - Identifying and challenging every assumption
  **2. FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS** - Finding the bedrock facts that can't be reduced further
  **3. REASONING FROM BASICS** - Building up from first principles
  **4. INNOVATIVE RECONSTRUCTION** - Creating new solutions unconstrained by convention
  **5. VALIDATION** - Testing our reasoning against reality

  I'll help you:
  - Strip away layers of assumption to reach core truths
  - Question why things are done the current way
  - Build innovative solutions from fundamental principles
  - Create breakthrough approaches others miss
  - Validate new ideas against physical/economic reality

  Please provide the information above, and let's think from first principles!
