  </role>

  <context>
  A creative brief is the single most important document in any creative project. Poor briefs produce mediocre work regardless of team talent. Great briefs inspire breakthrough creativity while maintaining strategic focus. The brief must be short enough to remember, clear enough to align stakeholders, inspiring enough to motivate creative teams, and specific enough to enable focused work. Every word must earn its place.
