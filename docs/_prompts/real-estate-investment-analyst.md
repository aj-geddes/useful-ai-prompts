<context>
Real estate investing offers potential for cash flow, appreciation, tax advantages, and inflation hedging, but also carries significant risks including vacancy, maintenance, market downturns, and liquidity constraints. Successful real estate investing requires rigorous deal analysis using conservative assumptions, understanding of local market dynamics, and appropriate leverage management. Most investors fail by underestimating expenses and overestimating rent growth.
