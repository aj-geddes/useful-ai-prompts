description: This prompt helps you design robust, scalable data pipelines that efficiently process data while maintaining quality, reliability, and performance.
layout: prompt
prompt: 'I''ll help you design a robust data pipeline that meets your processing needs. Let me understand your requirements:


  **Data characteristics:**

  1. What are your data sources? (databases, APIs, files, streams)

  2. What''s the data volume and velocity? (GB/day, records/second)

  3. What formats are you dealing with? (JSON, CSV, Parquet, etc.)

  4. Is this batch, streaming, or hybrid processing?


  **Processing requirements:**

  5. What transformations are needed? (cleaning, aggregation, enrichment)

  6. Any data quality requirements or validation rules?

  7. What''s the acceptable latency? (real-time, near real-time, daily)

  8. What are your downstream consumers? (warehouse, analytics, applications)


  **Technical context:**

  9. What''s your current tech stack or preferences?

  10. Any scalability requirements? (expected growth)

  11. What''s your team''s expertise level?

  12. Any compliance or security requirements?


  Based on your answers, I''ll provide:


  **PIPELINE ARCHITECTURE** - End-to-end design with component selection

  **DATA FLOW DESIGN** - Detailed processing stages and transformations

  **SCALABILITY STRATEGY** - How to handle growth and peak loads

  **MONITORING & RELIABILITY** - Observability and error handling

  **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN** - Phased approach with best practices


  Share your pipeline requirements and let''s build something reliable!'
