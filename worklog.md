## Session: 2025-07-20 - Product Strategy Enhancement

### Overview
Enhanced the existing product-strategy.md file based on patterns observed from administrative prompts and incorporating multi-persona approaches with layered thinking frameworks.

### Analysis Phase
Reviewed key files to understand the project's approach:
- `thinking-approaches.md`: Comprehensive list of thinking frameworks to layer into prompts
- `persona-profiles.md`: Detailed persona definitions for multi-perspective analysis
- `product-strategy.md`: Existing product strategy prompt to enhance

### Major Enhancements to Product Strategy Prompt

#### 1. Multi-Persona System
- Added three distinct personas: Strategic Product Manager, Systems Thinking Specialist, Market Strategist
- Each persona brings specific expertise, strengths, and perspectives
- Creates more comprehensive analysis than single-viewpoint approaches

#### 2. Layered Thinking Approaches
- Integrated specific thinking frameworks: First Principles, Scenario Planning, Causal Loop Analysis, Strategic Foresight
- Provides explicit mental models for the AI to apply during analysis

#### 3. Comprehensive Output Structure
Expanded the output format to include:
- Executive Summary with strategic thesis
- System Dynamics Map with visual representation
- Competitive Advantage Matrix
- Phased Product Roadmap with themes and system impacts
- Adaptive Strategy Mechanisms
- Risk Mitigation Framework
- Implementation Roadmap with quick wins
- Success Metrics & KPIs with tiered approach
- Stakeholder Communication Plan

#### 4. Enhanced Examples
- Replaced basic examples with three detailed, industry-specific scenarios
- Added example outputs showing how the framework applies in practice
- Covered B2B SaaS, Consumer IoT, and Enterprise Software contexts

#### 5. Expanded Research Notes
- Added development insights explaining design decisions
- Included optimal use cases and iteration patterns
- Listed common pitfalls and enhancement opportunities

### Key Improvements
1. **More Actionable**: Specific templates and matrices make outputs immediately usable
2. **Systems-Aware**: Deep focus on feedback loops and leverage points
3. **Adaptive**: Built-in mechanisms for strategy evolution
4. **Comprehensive**: Covers all aspects from vision to implementation
5. **Example-Rich**: Three detailed examples guide effective usage

### Technical Implementation
- Maintained consistency with established prompt structure (metadata, description, template, instructions, examples, research notes)
- Aligned with project's emphasis on layered thinking and multi-persona approaches
- Integrated learnings from administrative prompt development

### Next Steps Potential
- Create complementary prompts for specific strategy aspects (competitive analysis, market sizing, etc.)
- Develop prompts for other business categories (operations, finance, marketing)
- Create technical category prompts following similar patterns
- Build cross-references between related prompts
