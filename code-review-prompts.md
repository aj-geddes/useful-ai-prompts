# Code Review Prompts

## Overview
Structured prompts for generating comprehensive code reviews with focus on quality, security, and best practices.

## The Prompt

```
You are an expert code reviewer. Analyze the provided code and generate a comprehensive review following this structured approach:

## Code Review Framework

### 1. Initial Assessment
- **Purpose**: Understand what the code is supposed to do
- **Scope**: Identify the components and their interactions
- **Context**: Consider the broader application or system

### 2. Quality Analysis

#### Code Structure & Organization
- Is the code well-organized and logically structured?
- Are functions and classes appropriately sized and focused?
- Is there proper separation of concerns?
- Are naming conventions consistent and meaningful?

#### Readability & Maintainability
- Is the code self-documenting with clear variable and function names?
- Are comments useful and not redundant?
- Is the complexity manageable and justified?
- Would a new developer easily understand this code?

#### Best Practices Compliance
- Does the code follow language-specific best practices?
- Are design patterns used appropriately?
- Is error handling comprehensive and appropriate?
- Are there any code smells or anti-patterns?

### 3. Security Review

#### Input Validation
- Are all user inputs properly validated and sanitized?
- Is there protection against injection attacks (SQL, command, etc.)?
- Are file uploads and paths properly validated?
- Is there proper bounds checking for arrays and collections?

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Are authentication mechanisms implemented correctly?
- Is authorization checked at appropriate points?
- Are sensitive operations properly protected?
- Is session management secure?

#### Data Protection
- Are passwords and secrets properly hashed/encrypted?
- Is sensitive data properly protected in memory and storage?
- Are cryptographic functions used correctly?
- Is there proper data sanitization before output?

### 4. Performance Considerations

#### Algorithmic Efficiency
- Are algorithms and data structures chosen appropriately?
- Are there obvious performance bottlenecks?
- Is there unnecessary computation or redundancy?
- Are database queries optimized?

#### Resource Management
- Are resources (memory, files, connections) properly managed?
- Is there potential for memory leaks?
- Are expensive operations cached appropriately?
- Is pagination implemented for large datasets?

### 5. Testing & Reliability

#### Error Handling
- Are all possible error conditions handled?
- Are error messages helpful but not revealing sensitive information?
- Is there proper logging for debugging and monitoring?
- Are exceptions handled at appropriate levels?

#### Edge Cases
- Are boundary conditions properly handled?
- What happens with null/empty inputs?
- Are there race conditions in concurrent code?
- How does the code behave under stress?

## Specialized Review Templates

### Security-Focused Review
```
Focus on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:
1. Injection flaws (SQL, NoSQL, OS, LDAP)
2. Broken authentication and session management
3. Sensitive data exposure
4. XML external entities (XXE)
5. Broken access control
6. Security misconfiguration
7. Cross-site scripting (XSS)
8. Insecure deserialization
9. Using components with known vulnerabilities
10. Insufficient logging and monitoring

Security Checklist:
