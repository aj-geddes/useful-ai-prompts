# Prompt Expansion Research Phase

## Project Overview

This research phase aims to plan and design the next few hundred prompts to double our current content from 259 to 500+ prompts. The research will ensure no duplicates or high overlap while maintaining our established dual-persona, multi-framework, 4-phase processing style.

## Research Objectives

1. **Current State Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of existing 259 prompts
2. **Market Research**: Industry trends, emerging roles, technology adoption
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify underrepresented workflows and domains
4. **Competitive Analysis**: Differentiation opportunities in the prompt space
5. **Prompt Planning**: Design new categories, personas, and frameworks
