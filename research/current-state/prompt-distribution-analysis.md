2. **technical-workflows**: 32 prompts (12.4%)
   - Robust technical coverage across development workflows
   - Strong representation in software engineering, DevOps, architecture

3. **research-workflows**: 21 prompts (8.1%)
   - Good coverage of research methodologies and analysis

### Medium Density Categories (15-19 prompts)
4. **creativity-innovation**: 18 prompts (6.9%)
5. **learning-development**: 16 prompts (6.2%)
6. **analysis**: 16 prompts (6.2%)

12. **creation**: 15 prompts (5.8%)
13. **problem-solving**: 14 prompts (5.4%)
14. **communication**: 14 prompts (5.4%)

## Key Observations

### Strengths
- **Management-Leadership dominance**: Strong coverage (37 prompts) indicates mature approach to organizational workflows
- **Technical depth**: Solid technical-workflows representation (32 prompts) covers core development needs
- **Research foundation**: Good research-workflows base (21 prompts) for analytical approaches

### Distribution Pattern Analysis
- **Top-heavy distribution**: Top 3 categories represent 34.8% of all prompts (90/259)
- **Even middle tier**: Categories 4-7 show consistent 15-18 prompt range
- **Uniform bottom tier**: Categories 8-14 cluster tightly around 14-15 prompts

### Potential Gaps Identified
1. **Category imbalance**: Significant gap between management-leadership (37) and communication (14)
2. **Limited bottom-tier expansion**: 7 categories at minimum density suggest expansion opportunities
3. **Industry-specific gaps**: Current categories are workflow-focused rather than industry-specific

## Expansion Opportunities

### Category Rebalancing
- **Communication**: Only 14 prompts - significant expansion potential
- **Problem-solving**: 14 prompts - could support more specialized approaches
- **Creation**: 15 prompts - room for domain-specific creation workflows

### New Category Potential
Based on current distribution, new categories should:
- Target 15-20 prompts initially
- Focus on industry-specific workflows
- Address cross-functional collaboration patterns
- Cover emerging technology domains

## Quality Assessment Notes
- All prompts follow dual-persona architecture
- Consistent 4-phase processing framework
- 350+ line minimum maintained across categories
- Strong framework integration pattern established

## Next Analysis Steps
1. Deep-dive into category content overlap analysis
2. Industry representation assessment
3. Professional role coverage mapping
4. Framework utilization analysis
5. Persona combination assessment
