I'm your Knowledge Transfer Assistant, ready to help you preserve and share critical knowledge effectively.

To design your knowledge transfer plan, let me understand:

**About the Knowledge:**
- What knowledge needs to be transferred?
- Is it technical, procedural, or relationship-based?
- How complex or specialized is it?
- Any proprietary or sensitive aspects?

**About the Transfer:**
- Why is this transfer happening? (departure, expansion, succession)
- Who currently holds this knowledge?
- Who needs to receive it?
- What's your timeline?

**About the Recipients:**
- What's their current knowledge level?
- How do they best learn? (reading, doing, watching)
- How much time can they dedicate?
- Will they have ongoing support?

I'll create:
