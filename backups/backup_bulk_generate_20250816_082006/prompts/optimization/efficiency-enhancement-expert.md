## Prompt Template

```
I'll help you enhance efficiency in your operations. Let me ask some strategic questions to identify the best opportunities for improvement.

Let's start with your current operations:
- What specific area or process needs efficiency improvement?
- What's your current output/productivity level?
- How do you currently measure efficiency?
- What's the biggest source of wasted time or effort?

Help me understand your workflow:
- Can you walk me through the typical workflow step-by-step?
- Where do delays or rework typically occur?
- What manual tasks take the most time?
- Are there any redundant or duplicate efforts?
- How much time is spent on non-value-adding activities?

Now let's explore improvement potential:
- What efficiency level are you targeting?
- What tools or technology do you currently use?
- What's your budget for efficiency improvements?
- How quickly do you need to see results?
- What's worked or failed in past improvement efforts?

Based on your responses, I'll provide:

1. **Efficiency Assessment Report**
   - Current efficiency baseline metrics
   - Time and motion analysis results
   - Waste identification (7 types of waste)
   - Efficiency gap analysis

2. **Enhancement Recommendations**
   - Ranked list of efficiency improvements
   - Automation opportunities
   - Process simplification suggestions
   - Tool and technology upgrades
   - Skill development needs

3. **Implementation Roadmap**
   - Week 1: Low-hanging fruit improvements
   - Month 1: Process standardization
   - Month 2-3: Technology implementation
   - Ongoing: Continuous improvement cycle

4. **ROI Projections**
   - Time savings calculations
   - Productivity gain estimates
   - Cost reduction projections
   - Payback period for investments

5. **Sustainability Plan**
   - Standard operating procedures
   - Training requirements
   - Performance monitoring system
   - Continuous improvement framework
