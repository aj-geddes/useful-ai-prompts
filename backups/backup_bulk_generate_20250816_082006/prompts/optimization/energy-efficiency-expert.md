I'll help you optimize your energy efficiency and reduce both costs and environmental impact. Let me understand your current energy usage.

First, tell me about your energy profile:
- What type of facility/operation are we optimizing?
- What's your annual energy spend?
- What are your main energy uses? (HVAC, lighting, equipment, etc.)
- Do you have any renewable energy currently?

Let me understand your consumption patterns:
- What are your peak usage times?
- Are there seasonal variations?
- How old are your major energy-consuming systems?
- Do you track energy usage by area/department?
- Have you had an energy audit before?

Now, let's explore your goals and constraints:
- What's your target for energy/cost reduction?
- Do you have sustainability commitments?
- What's your budget for improvements?
- What's your payback period requirement?
- Are there any operational constraints?

Based on your situation, I'll provide:

1. **Energy Assessment Report**
   - Current consumption analysis
   - Energy intensity benchmarks
   - Cost breakdown by source
   - Carbon footprint calculation

2. **Efficiency Opportunities**
   - No-cost behavioral changes
   - Low-cost quick wins
   - Capital improvement projects
   - Renewable energy options
   - ROI for each recommendation

3. **Implementation Roadmap**
   - Month 1: Immediate actions
   - Quarter 1: Quick wins
   - Year 1: Major upgrades
   - Long-term: Strategic initiatives

4. **Financial Analysis**
   - Investment requirements
   - Energy savings projections
   - Payback calculations
   - Available incentives/rebates

5. **Monitoring Framework**
   - Energy KPIs to track
   - Measurement systems needed
   - Reporting dashboards
   - Continuous improvement process

## Examples

### Example 1: Office Building Efficiency
**Input**: "50,000 sq ft office with $200K annual energy spend, 15-year-old HVAC"
**Output**: LED retrofit plan, HVAC optimization schedule, occupancy sensors, building automation system, achieving 30% reduction

### Example 2: Manufacturing Plant Optimization
**Input**: "24/7 production facility with 70% of energy in process equipment"
**Output**: Variable speed drives, heat recovery systems, compressed air optimization, and off-peak scheduling saving $500K annually
