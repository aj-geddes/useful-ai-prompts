## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. VP of Product, managing 3 teams and product strategy
2. Back-to-back meetings Mon-Thu, Fridays for planning
3. 35 hours/week in meetings (70% of time)
4. Most productive 8-10 AM and 4-6 PM

5. Double-booked constantly, no time for strategic thinking
6. Weekly status meetings with little value, too many FYI meetings
7. Daily - answering emails at night and weekends
8. Maybe 2-3 hours per week of uninterrupted time

9. Q4 product launch, team development, stakeholder alignment
10. Product strategy, 1-on-1s with directs, customer research
11. 50/50 would be ideal
12. CEO, engineering partners, direct reports

Sample week: 15 status meetings, 8 1-on-1s, 5 strategic planning,
10 ad-hoc requests, 3 all-hands, 2 customer calls
```

**Assistant Output:**

Based on your VP Product role with 70% meeting load, here's your calendar optimization plan:

## CALENDAR AUDIT RESULTS

**Current State Analysis:**
```
Time Allocation:
├── Meetings: 35 hrs (70%)
├── Email/Admin: 10 hrs (20%)
├── Strategic Work: 3 hrs (6%)
└── White Space: 2 hrs (4%)

Meeting Value Score:
├── High Value: 8 hrs (23%) - Customer calls, 1-on-1s
├── Medium Value: 12 hrs (34%) - Planning sessions
└── Low Value: 15 hrs (43%) - Status meetings, FYI
```

**Key Issues Identified:**
1. **Strategic Misalignment**: Only 6% on top priorities
2. **Meeting Bloat**: 43% low-value meetings
3. **Context Switching**: Average 8 transitions/day
4. **Energy Mismatch**: Peak hours filled with status meetings

## OPTIMIZATION PLAN (4-Week Transformation)

### Week 1: Quick Wins
- **Cancel/Decline**: 5 recurring status meetings → Save 5 hrs
- **Convert to Async**: 3 FYI meetings → Slack updates
- **Batch Similar**: Group all 1-on-1s to Tue/Thu → Better flow

### Week 2: Restructure
- **Time Blocks**: 
  - Mon/Wed 8-10 AM: Strategic thinking
  - Tue/Thu 8-10 AM: 1-on-1s
  - Fri AM: No meetings (planning time)
- **Office Hours**: Wed 2-4 PM for ad-hoc requests

### Week 3: Delegate & Automate
- **Delegate**: 4 meetings to team leads with decision framework
- **Automate**: Calendar scheduling links with buffers
- **Templates**: Standard meeting agendas and time limits

### Week 4: Protect & Optimize
- **Focus Blocks**: 2-hour blocks marked "Strategic Work - Do Not Book"
- **Meeting Budgets**: Max 20 hrs/week policy
- **Energy Matching**: Customer calls during peak hours only

## MEETING DECLINE TEMPLATES

**For Status Meetings:**
"Thanks for including me. To optimize our time, could we try async updates for 2 weeks? I'll review the Slack summary and jump in only when needed. This helps me focus on [strategic priority]."

**For FYI Meetings:**
"I appreciate the invite. Since this is informational, could you send me the key points via email/recording? Happy to review async and follow up with questions."

**For Redundant Meetings:**
"Looking at this agenda, [Team Member] can represent our team effectively. I'll sync with them afterward. This helps me maintain focus on [Q4 launch]."
