## Description

This prompt helps you build bridges that connect different blockchains, allowing users to transfer assets and data between networks like Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and others.

## Prompt

```
I'll help you build a cross-chain bridge to connect different blockchains. Let me understand what you want to connect:

**Your bridge requirements:**
1. Which blockchains do you want to connect? (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, etc.)
2. What assets will be transferred? (tokens, NFTs, data)
3. What's your expected transaction volume? (daily transfers)
4. Who are your target users? (DeFi traders, businesses, general users)

**Technical setup:**
5. What's your development experience? (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
6. Do you prefer existing solutions or custom development?
7. What's your budget for development and security audits?
8. Do you need real-time transfers or can users wait for confirmations?

**Security and operations:**
9. What security level do you need? (basic, enterprise-grade)
10. Will you run validators yourself or use third-party services?
11. Do you need insurance for user funds?
12. What compliance requirements do you have?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

```

## Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
1. Want to connect Ethereum and Polygon for our DeFi protocol
2. ERC-20 tokens (USDC, USDT, our native token), eventually NFTs
3. Expecting 100-500 transfers per day initially, could grow to 10,000+
4. DeFi users who want cheaper transactions on Polygon but need Ethereum liquidity

5. Intermediate - we have Solidity developers but new to bridge development
6. Prefer using proven components but custom UI and some custom logic
7. $100K development budget, willing to spend $50K on security audits
8. Users can wait 10-15 minutes for security, but want clear status updates

9. Enterprise-grade - handling user funds so security is critical
10. Prefer third-party validators initially, maybe run our own later
11. Yes, want insurance coverage for peace of mind
12. Need to comply with US regulations, KYC for large transfers
```

**Assistant Output:**

Here's your cross-chain bridge development plan:

## BRIDGE ARCHITECTURE

### Recommended Approach: Lock-and-Mint Bridge with Validator Network

**Why This Works for You**:
```
Use Case: Ethereum ↔ Polygon token transfers
Security Level: Enterprise-grade with insurance
Volume: Medium scale, room to grow
Budget: Sufficient for proper security implementation
```

## SECURITY STRATEGY

### Multi-Layer Security Model

**Smart Contract Security**:
```
1. Time Delays (1-24 hours for large transfers)
   - Transfers >$50K require 12-hour delay
   - Transfers >$500K require 24-hour delay
   - Emergency cancellation during delay period

2. Rate Limiting
   - Max $1M per day total bridge volume
   - Max $100K per address per day
   - Dynamic limits based on validator consensus

3. Multi-Sig Protection
   - 5/8 validator signatures required
   - Admin functions require 3/5 team multi-sig
   - Emergency pause requires 2/5 signatures
```

**Validator Network Security**:
```
Chainlink Decentralized Validators:
- 15 independent validator nodes
- Economic incentives via staking
- Slashing for malicious behavior
- Automatic rotation of validator set

Backup Systems:
- Optimistic challenge period
- Community watchdog contracts
- Automated anomaly detection
- Manual override capabilities
```

### Insurance Coverage
