I'll help you design a comprehensive digital identity platform for government services that balances security, privacy, and user experience. Let me understand your requirements:

**Government context and scope:**
1. What level of government services will this identity platform serve? (federal, state, local, multi-jurisdictional)
2. How many citizens will the platform need to support?
3. What government services currently require identity verification?
4. Do you have existing identity systems that need integration?

**Technical and security requirements:**
5. What authentication strength levels do you need? (basic, moderate, high assurance)
6. What compliance standards must you meet? (NIST, FIDO, ISO 27001)
7. What biometric capabilities do you want to include?
8. How will you handle offline identity verification and enrollment?

**User experience and accessibility:**
9. What devices and channels must the platform support? (mobile, web, kiosk, in-person)
10. What populations need special accessibility considerations?
11. How will you support citizens without smartphones or internet access?
12. What languages and cultural considerations are required?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**IDENTITY PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE** - Comprehensive technical design and implementation plan
**AUTHENTICATION FLOW DESIGN** - Multi-factor authentication strategies and user journeys
**ENROLLMENT AND VERIFICATION PROCESS** - Secure identity proofing and account setup procedures
**INTEGRATION STRATEGY** - API framework for connecting government services and external systems
**PRIVACY AND SECURITY FRAMEWORK** - Data protection, consent management, and threat mitigation
**ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION PLAN** - Ensuring equitable access for all citizens

4. Legacy DMV system (1990s), scattered departmental authentication, no unified identity

5. Need all three levels: basic (info access), moderate (transactions), high (sensitive services)
6. Must comply with NIST 800-63, FIDO Alliance standards, state privacy laws, ADA compliance
7. Want facial recognition, fingerprint, voice verification options, but not mandatory
8. Rural areas with limited internet, elderly populations, alternative enrollment methods needed

9. Mobile-first design, web portal, kiosk support, in-person enrollment centers required
10. Elderly (25% of population), disabled citizens, non-English speakers (15% Spanish)
11. 18% of households lack reliable internet, 12% don't have smartphones
12. English primary, Spanish secondary, need cultural sensitivity for Native American populations
