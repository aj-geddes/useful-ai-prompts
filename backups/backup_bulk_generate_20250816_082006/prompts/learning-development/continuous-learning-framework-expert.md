Let's design a continuous learning framework tailored to your needs:

**Current State**
- What learning activities currently happen?
- How is learning time allocated and protected?
- What resources are available (budget, tools, time)?
- What are the main barriers to learning?

**Desired Outcomes**

Based on your situation, I'll develop:
