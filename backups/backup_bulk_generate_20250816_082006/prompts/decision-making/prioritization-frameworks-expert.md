## Prompt

Let's prioritize your items effectively using the right framework for your situation. I'll help you get clarity on what to focus on first:

**Prioritization Context:**
- What are you trying to prioritize? (tasks, projects, features, etc.)
- How many items need prioritizing?
- What's your main constraint? (time, budget, people)
- Any deadlines or fixed commitments?

**Current Situation:**
- What's currently getting attention?
- What's being neglected?
- Any items causing stress or bottlenecks?
- Stakeholder pressures or expectations?

**Success Factors:**
- How do you define value or success?
- What are your strategic goals?
- Risk tolerance level?
- Need quick wins or long-term impact?

**Available Resources:**
- Team capacity and skills?
- Budget constraints?
- Time horizons?
- Dependencies between items?

Based on your situation, I'll apply the most suitable framework:

## PRIORITIZATION ANALYSIS

### Recommended Framework: [Best fit for your context]
- **Why this framework**: [Rationale based on your needs]

### Priority Matrix

**[Framework Name - e.g., Impact/Effort, Eisenhower, MoSCoW, RICE]**

| Priority Level | Items | Rationale | Action |
|----------------|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Critical/Must Do** | • [Item 1]<br>• [Item 2] | [Why these first] | [Immediate action] |
| **High Priority** | • [Item 3]<br>• [Item 4] | [Value/urgency] | [Schedule soon] |
| **Medium Priority** | • [Item 5]<br>• [Item 6] | [Important but...] | [Plan for later] |
| **Low Priority** | • [Item 7]<br>• [Item 8] | [Nice to have] | [Defer/delegate] |

### Visual Priority Map
```
High Impact ↑
            | [Item A]     | [Item B]
            | (Do First)   | (Do Next)
            |--------------|-------------
            | [Item C]     | [Item D]
            | (Schedule)   | (Delegate)
Low Impact  ↓
            Low Effort →   High Effort
```

### Scoring Breakdown
| Item | Value Score | Urgency | Effort | Risk | Total Priority |
|------|------------|---------|---------|------|----------------|
| [A] | 9/10 | High | Low | Low | 9.2 |
| [B] | 8/10 | Medium | Medium | Medium | 7.5 |

### Recommended Sequence
1. **Week 1-2**: [Highest priority items]
   - Expected outcome: [Value delivered]
2. **Week 3-4**: [Next tier items]
   - Expected outcome: [Value delivered]
3. **Month 2**: [Medium priority items]
   - Expected outcome: [Value delivered]

### Items to Eliminate/Defer
❌ **Remove from list:**
- [Item X]: [Reason - no longer relevant]
- [Item Y]: [Reason - duplicates other work]

⏸️ **Defer indefinitely:**
- [Item Z]: [Reason - low value vs effort]

### Resource Allocation
- 60% capacity → Critical items
- 30% capacity → High priority items
- 10% buffer → Emergencies/changes

### Review Triggers
Reprioritize when:
- New urgent items emerge
- Resources change significantly
- Strategic goals shift
- Monthly review date
