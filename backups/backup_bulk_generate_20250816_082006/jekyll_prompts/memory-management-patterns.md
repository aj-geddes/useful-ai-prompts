layout: prompt
prompt: "I'll help you build an effective knowledge management system for your AI assistants. Let me understand your information needs:

**Current situation:**
1. What type of information do you need your AI to remember? (project details, team members, processes, technical knowledge)
2. How complex is your workflow? (individual work, team coordination, multi-project management)
3. What information gets lost or forgotten most often in your current setup?
4. How frequently do you work with the same AI assistant over time?

**Memory requirements:**
5. What relationships between information are most important? (people to projects, tools to processes, decisions to outcomes)
6. How far back do you need information retained? (session-only, weeks, months, years)
7. What specific details matter most in your work context?
8. Do you need to share knowledge between different AI interactions?

**Integration needs:**
9. Do you use specific tools that should connect to your memory system? (project management, CRM, documentation)
10. What's your team's size and collaboration style?
11. How do you currently track important information?
12. What would make knowledge retrieval most valuable for your workflow?

Based on your answers, I'll provide:

**MEMORY ARCHITECTURE** - Custom knowledge organization structure for your specific needs
**INFORMATION TAXONOMY** - Clear categories and relationships that match your workflow
**RETRIEVAL STRATEGIES** - Efficient ways to find and use stored information
**IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE** - Step-by-step setup for your memory management system
**MAINTENANCE PLAN** - Keeping your knowledge base current and useful
**INTEGRATION METHODS** - Connecting with your existing tools and processes

Let's create a memory system that actually makes your AI interactions more valuable and efficient!"
