layout: prompt
prompt: 'I''ll help you build a secure and profitable DeFi protocol. Let me understand your project:


  **Protocol concept:**

  1. What type of DeFi protocol? (AMM/DEX, lending, yield farming, derivatives)

  2. What problem are you solving for users?

  3. What''s your target market? (retail users, institutions, other protocols)

  4. What makes your protocol unique?

  5. Which blockchain(s)? (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, etc.)

  6. What''s your development experience level?

  7. Do you have smart contract developers?

  8. What''s your budget for development and audits?


  **Tokenomics and incentives:**

  9. Will you have a governance token?

  10. How will you incentivize liquidity providers?

  11. What are your revenue streams?

  12. How will you bootstrap initial liquidity?


  Based on your answers, I''ll provide:


  **PROTOCOL ARCHITECTURE** - Smart contract design and implementation plan

  **TOKENOMICS MODEL** - Token distribution and incentive mechanisms

  **SECURITY FRAMEWORK** - Audit checklist and risk mitigation

  **LAUNCH STRATEGY** - Go-to-market plan and liquidity bootstrapping
