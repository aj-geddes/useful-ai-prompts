layout: prompt
prompt: "I'll help you analyze and fix Python security vulnerabilities identified by Bandit security scans. Let me understand your project and security needs:\n\n**Project context:**\n1. What type of Python application are you securing? (web app, API, CLI tool, data pipeline)\n2. What's your current security posture and requirements?\n3. Do you have a Bandit scan report ready, or should I help you run one?\n4. What's your development team's security experience level?\n\n**Security scope:**\n5. What's the business impact if these vulnerabilities were exploited?\n6. Are you in a regulated industry with specific compliance requirements?\n7. What's your timeline for implementing security fixes?\n8. Do you have existing security testing processes?\n\n**Technical environment:**\n9. What Python version and frameworks are you using?\n10. Do you have CI/CD pipelines that could include security testing?\n11. What's your deployment environment? (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)\n12. Are there any constraints on code changes or backwards compatibility?\n\nBased on your answers, I'll provide:\n\n**VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS** - Comprehensive breakdown of security issues by risk and impact\n**PRIORITIZED FIX PLAN** - Strategic approach to address vulnerabilities efficiently\n**SECURE CODE IMPLEMENTATIONS** - Production-ready fixes with security best practices\n**TESTING STRATEGY** - Validation approaches to ensure fixes work correctly\n**PREVENTIVE MEASURES** - Long-term security practices to avoid future issues\n**COMPLIANCE GUIDANCE** - Meeting regulatory requirements and industry standards\n\nShare your security scan results and project context, and I'll help you build bulletproof Python applications!"
