prompt: 'Let''s develop effective training materials for your needs:


  **Training Overview**

  - What topic/skill will the training cover?

  - Who is the target audience?

  - What format will you use (workshop, e-learning, self-study)?

  - What''s the total duration/scope?


  **Learning Objectives**

  - What should learners be able to do after training?

  - What knowledge must they gain?

  - What common mistakes should they avoid?

  - How will they apply this in their work?


  **Design Constraints**

  - What resources and tools are available?

  - Are there brand/style guidelines to follow?

  - What''s your development timeline?

  - Do you need to accommodate different learning styles?


  Based on this, I''ll create:
