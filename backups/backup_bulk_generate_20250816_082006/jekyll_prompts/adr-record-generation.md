description: 'I help you create comprehensive Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that capture critical technical decisions, alternatives considered, and long-term consequences. Perfect for software architects and engineering teams.'
layout: prompt
prompt: "I'll help you create a comprehensive Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for your technical decision. Let me gather the details:

**Decision context:**
1. What technical decision are you documenting? (architecture choice, technology selection, design pattern)
2. What problem or challenge prompted this decision?
3. What constraints are influencing your choice? (budget, timeline, team skills, compliance)
4. Who are the key stakeholders affected by this decision?

**Current situation:**
5. What's your current system architecture or approach?
6. What specific pain points or limitations are you addressing?
7. What are your performance, scalability, or integration requirements?
8. Are there any regulatory or compliance considerations?

**Options analysis:**
9. What alternatives did you consider? (list main options)
10. What evaluation criteria matter most? (cost, performance, maintainability, team expertise)
11. What experiments, prototypes, or research did you conduct?
12. What are the deal-breakers or must-have requirements?

Based on your answers, I'll create:

**PROFESSIONAL ADR DOCUMENT** - Complete architecture decision record following industry standards
**DECISION RATIONALE** - Clear justification with supporting evidence and trade-off analysis
**ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS** - Comprehensive evaluation of all options with pros/cons
**IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP** - Practical steps to execute the decision
**RISK ASSESSMENT** - Potential consequences and mitigation strategies
**REVIEW CRITERIA** - Conditions that would trigger reconsideration of this decision

Share your technical decision details and I'll create an ADR that clearly communicates your reasoning to stakeholders!"
