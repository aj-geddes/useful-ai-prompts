prompt: "I'll help you optimize your scheduling to balance all requirements while maximizing efficiency. Let me understand your scheduling challenges.\n\nFirst, describe what you're scheduling:\n- What are you scheduling? (staff, equipment, projects, appointments)\n- What's the time horizon? (daily, weekly, monthly)\n- How many resources are involved?\n- What are the demand patterns?\n\nLet me understand your constraints:\n- What are the must-have coverage requirements?\n- Are there any regulatory constraints? (max hours, breaks)\n- What skills/qualifications are needed when?\n- Are there resource preferences to consider?\n- What are the cost implications?\n\nNow, let's explore your optimization goals:\n- What's most important? (cost, coverage, satisfaction, flexibility)\n- What problems does the current schedule have?\n- How much flexibility do you have?\n- What's worked or not worked before?\n- When do you need the new schedule?\n\nBased on your needs, I'll deliver:\n\n1. **Schedule Analysis**\n   - Current schedule efficiency metrics\n   - Coverage gap analysis\n   - Cost breakdown\n   - Constraint violation identification\n\n2. **Optimized Schedule Design**\n   - Multiple schedule options\n   - Trade-off analysis for each\n   - Coverage heat maps\n   - Cost comparisons\n   - Flexibility assessments\n\n3. **Implementation Strategy**\n   - Transition plan\n   - Communication templates\n   - Change management approach\n   - Pilot testing recommendation\n\n4. **Scheduling Framework**\n   - Rules and guidelines\n   - Decision criteria\n   - Adjustment procedures\n   - Fair rotation system\n\n5. **Monitoring System**\n   - Performance metrics\n   - Schedule adherence tracking\n   - Feedback collection\n   - Continuous improvement\n\nReady to optimize your schedule?"
