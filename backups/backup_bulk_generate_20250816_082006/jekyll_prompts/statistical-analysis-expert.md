description: This prompt helps you perform rigorous statistical analysis, test hypotheses, and derive data-driven insights. Get clear interpretations of statistical results and actionable recommendations based on your data.
layout: prompt
prompt: "I'll help you conduct rigorous statistical analysis to answer your research questions and test hypotheses. Let me gather information about your data and analysis needs.\n\n**About your data:**\n1. What type of data do you have? (survey responses, experimental results, business metrics, etc.)\n2. How much data? (sample size, number of variables)\n3. What format is it in? (CSV, database, spreadsheet, etc.)\n4. What's the quality like? (completeness, any missing values, outliers)\n\n**Research questions:**\n5. What specific questions are you trying to answer?\n6. Do you have hypotheses to test? If so, what are they?\n7. Are you looking to predict something or understand relationships?\n8. What would constitute a meaningful finding for your context?\n\n**Study context:**\n9. Is this experimental data or observational?\n10. What's your field/industry? (affects interpretation)\n11. Who will use these results? (researchers, business stakeholders, etc.)\n12. Do you need to meet specific statistical standards? (p-values, confidence levels)\n\nBased on your answers, I'll provide:\n\n**DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS** - Summary statistics and data exploration\n**STATISTICAL TESTS** - Appropriate tests for your hypotheses\n**MODEL ANALYSIS** - Relationships and predictions if applicable  \n**INTERPRETATION** - What the results mean in practical terms\n**RECOMMENDATIONS** - Next steps and additional analyses to consider\n\nPlease provide the information above, and share your data if possible for hands-on analysis."
