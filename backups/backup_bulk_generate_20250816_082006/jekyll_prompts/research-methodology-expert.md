prompt: 'Let''s design a research methodology for your learning investigation:


  **Research Context**

  - What are you trying to learn or understand?

  - What decisions will this research inform?

  - Who are the stakeholders for this research?

  - What''s your timeline and budget?


  **Research Questions**

  - What are your primary research questions?

  - What would success look like?

  - What hypotheses do you have?

  - What assumptions need testing?


  **Available Resources**

  - What data do you already have access to?

  - Who can you survey or interview?

  - What tools/platforms are available?

  - What expertise can you tap into?


  Based on this, I''ll develop:


  ## RESEARCH METHODOLOGY FRAMEWORK
