prompt: "I'll help you streamline your workflow for maximum efficiency. Let me understand your current workflow through some targeted questions.\n\nFirst, describe your workflow:\n- What's the workflow you want to streamline?\n- What triggers the workflow to start?\n- What's the desired end result?\n- How many people/systems are involved?\n\nLet me map the current process:\n- Can you list the main steps in order?\n- Where are the handoffs between people/systems?\n- Which steps take the longest?\n- Where do errors or delays typically occur?\n- Are there any approval bottlenecks?\n\nNow, let's identify improvement opportunities:\n- Which steps feel unnecessary or redundant?\n- What's currently done manually that could be automated?\n- Are there parallel paths that could reduce total time?\n- What tools/systems do you currently use?\n- What's your budget for new tools or automation?\n\nBased on your workflow, I'll deliver:\n\n1. **Current State Analysis**\n   - Visual workflow diagram\n   - Time and effort per step\n   - Bottleneck identification\n   - Redundancy and waste analysis\n\n2. **Streamlined Workflow Design**\n   - Optimized process flow\n   - Steps to eliminate or combine\n   - Parallel processing opportunities\n   - Automation recommendations\n   - Integration points\n\n3. **Implementation Roadmap**\n   - Week 1: Quick process fixes\n   - Week 2-4: Tool implementation\n   - Month 2: Automation rollout\n   - Month 3: Full optimization\n\n4. **Technology Stack**\n   - Recommended tools/platforms\n   - Integration requirements\n   - Automation possibilities\n   - Cost-benefit analysis\n\n5. **Change Management Plan**\n   - Training requirements\n   - Transition strategy\n   - Communication plan\n   - Success metrics\n\nReady to map your current workflow?"
