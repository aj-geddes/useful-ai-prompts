Subject: AI Prompt Library Resource for [Blog Name] Readers

Hi [Name],

I've been following [Blog Name] and really enjoyed your recent post on [specific post]. Your insights on [specific topic] really resonated with me.

I recently built something that might be valuable for your readers: a searchable library of 278+ professional AI prompts organized by workflow and industry.

The site (https://aj-geddes.github.io/useful-ai-prompts/) focuses specifically on business and professional use cases rather than creative writing. Each prompt uses a "dual-persona" approach combining multiple expert perspectives.

Key features your readers might find useful:
‚Ä¢ Instant search across all prompts
‚Ä¢ 18 specialized categories (Technical, Leadership, Analysis, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Copy-to-clipboard functionality
‚Ä¢ Mobile-responsive design
‚Ä¢ Completely free, no signup required

Would this be something you'd consider mentioning in a future post about AI productivity tools? I'd be happy to provide additional context or answer any questions.

Best regards,
[Your name]
```
